# How Orc Works

Orc uses a revolutionary systematic approach to generate high-quality content through AI orchestration. This document explains the concepts behind Orc's unique capabilities.

## The Innovation: Word Budget Engineering

Traditional AI systems often produce shallow or uneven content because they don't manage their "creative resources" effectively. Orc solves this with **Word Budget Engineering**:

### How It Works

1. **Budget Allocation**: When you request a 50,000-word novel, Orc allocates specific word counts to each part:
   - Overall structure planning: 2,000 words
   - Chapter outlines: 5,000 words  
   - Character development: 3,000 words
   - Actual prose: 40,000 words

2. **Quality Through Specificity**: Instead of asking AI to "write a novel," Orc breaks it down:
   - "Design a three-act structure with these themes"
   - "Create a detailed plan for Chapter 3 (2,500 words)"
   - "Write scene 2 of Chapter 3 focusing on character conflict"

3. **Systematic Quality**: Each phase has specific quality criteria:
   - Planning must include complete story arcs
   - Characters must have clear motivations
   - Scenes must advance the plot
   - Prose must maintain consistent style

## Why This Matters for Your Content

### Fiction Generation
When generating fiction, Orc ensures:
- **Consistent plot**: No forgotten subplots or character inconsistencies
- **Balanced pacing**: Each chapter gets appropriate development
- **Deep character development**: Dedicated focus on character arcs
- **Quality prose**: Multiple refinement passes for style and voice

### Code Generation
For code projects, Orc provides:
- **Complete architecture**: Full system design before implementation
- **Consistent patterns**: Same coding style throughout
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error cases considered
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and README generation

## The Multi-Phase Process

Orc generates content through specialized phases, each with a specific purpose:

### 1. Planning Phase
- Analyzes your request
- Creates a detailed outline
- Allocates word budgets
- Sets quality criteria

### 2. Content Generation Phase
- Works on multiple sections in parallel
- Maintains consistency across parts
- Follows the established plan
- Manages pacing and flow

### 3. Refinement Phase
- Reviews generated content
- Ensures quality standards
- Fixes inconsistencies
- Polishes final output

### 4. Assembly Phase
- Combines all parts
- Formats final output
- Creates organized file structure
- Generates any supporting files

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Processing
Orc can work on multiple chapters or code modules simultaneously while maintaining consistency. This dramatically reduces generation time without sacrificing quality.

### Checkpointing and Resume
Long projects are automatically saved at each phase. If interrupted, you can resume exactly where you left off:
```bash
orc resume SESSION_ID
```

### Quality Verification
Every output goes through verification:
- **Completeness**: All requested content is present
- **Consistency**: Characters, plot, and style remain consistent
- **Accuracy**: Code compiles and follows best practices
- **Formatting**: Proper structure and organization

### Iterative Refinement
Orc can make multiple improvement passes:
- Identify areas needing improvement
- Apply targeted enhancements
- Verify improvements meet quality standards
- Repeat until optimal quality is achieved

## Customization Options

### Model Selection
Choose the AI model that best fits your needs:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Best balance of speed and quality
- **Claude 3 Opus**: Highest quality, longer generation time
- **GPT-4**: Alternative option with different strengths

### Output Formats
Orc supports various output formats:
- **Markdown**: Default format, easy to read and convert
- **Plain Text**: Simple format for maximum compatibility
- **Structured Folders**: Organized by chapters/modules
- **JSON**: For programmatic processing

### Quality vs Speed Trade-offs
You can adjust settings to prioritize:
- **Maximum Quality**: More iterations, longer timeouts
- **Balanced**: Default settings for most use cases
- **Fast Generation**: Reduced iterations, shorter timeouts

## Technical Benefits

### Reliability
- **Automatic retries**: Handles temporary failures gracefully
- **Progress saving**: Never lose work due to interruptions
- **Error recovery**: Continues from last successful point
- **Rate limit handling**: Respects API limits automatically

### Efficiency
- **Parallel processing**: Faster generation without quality loss
- **Smart caching**: Avoids redundant API calls
- **Resource optimization**: Uses API tokens efficiently
- **Incremental generation**: See results as they're created

### Scalability
- **Handle large projects**: Novels, full applications, documentation sets
- **Concurrent operations**: Multiple projects simultaneously
- **Flexible architecture**: Adapts to different content types
- **Plugin system**: Extend for new domains
