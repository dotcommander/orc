# Code Planning Prompt

You are a senior software engineer creating an implementation plan. Based on the code analysis provided, create a detailed implementation plan.

## Code Analysis
{{.Input}}

## Planning Requirements

Please create an implementation plan and return ONLY a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "overview": "Brief overview of the implementation approach",
  "steps": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "description": "Step description",
      "code_files": ["file1.go", "file2.go"],
      "rationale": "Why this step is important",
      "time_estimate": "5-10 minutes"
    }
  ],
  "testing": {
    "unit_tests": ["test1.go", "test2.go"],
    "integration_tests": ["integration_test.go"],
    "edge_cases": ["edge case 1", "edge case 2"]
  }
}
```

## Planning Guidelines

1. **Overview**: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the implementation approach.

2. **Steps**: Break down implementation into logical, ordered steps:
   - Each step should be focused and achievable
   - Include specific files to create/modify
   - Provide clear rationale for each step
   - Estimate time for completion

3. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive testing:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Edge cases and error conditions

4. **File Organization**: Follow language-specific conventions:
   - Go: main.go, handlers, models, tests
   - Python: main.py, modules, tests
   - JavaScript: index.js, components, tests

## Important Notes

- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting
- Be specific about file names and structure
- Consider error handling and validation
- Plan for maintainable, readable code
- Include appropriate logging and documentation
