<examples>
<example>
<input>Create a REST API for user authentication with JWT tokens, including registration, login, password reset, and user profile management. Must be secure and production-ready.</input>
<analysis>
This is a critical security component requiring careful design. Key considerations:
- Authentication endpoints need rate limiting and brute force protection
- Password handling requires proper hashing (bcrypt minimum)
- JWT implementation needs secure token generation and refresh patterns
- Input validation essential for all endpoints
- Comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- Database design must prevent SQL injection
- HTTPS enforcement and security headers required

Architecture: Clean layered approach with separation of concerns
- Router layer for HTTP handling
- Service layer for business logic
- Repository layer for data access
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns

<thinking_process>
Before creating your implementation plan, analyze these key areas:

1. **Architecture Assessment**: What architectural pattern best serves this specific requirement? Consider microservices, monolith, serverless, event-driven, etc.

2. **Security Analysis**: What are the security implications and threat vectors? How will you implement defense in depth?

3. **Performance Requirements**: What are the scalability and performance constraints? How will you optimize for the expected load?

4. **Technology Selection**: Which technologies and frameworks are most appropriate? Consider team expertise, ecosystem maturity, and long-term maintainability.

5. **Risk Mitigation**: What could go wrong and how will you prevent or handle failures? Consider both technical and business risks.

6. **Testing Strategy**: How will you ensure quality and reliability? What types of testing are critical for this specific use case?

Document your reasoning for major architectural and technology decisions.
