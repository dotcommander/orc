The rain fell hard on the city. John walked down the street. He was thinking about his ex-wife. She had left him last month. He missed her. The divorce papers were in his pocket. He didn't want to sign them but knew he had to. Lightning flashed. Thunder followed. John kept walking.
</input>
<analysis>
This opening has potential but needs significant development:
- Overuse of simple sentences creates choppy rhythm
- Telling rather than showing emotional state  
- Generic details (rain, city, street) miss opportunity for atmosphere
- No sensory immersion beyond visual
- Character introduction lacks distinctiveness
- Missing narrative hook to pull readers forward
</analysis>

The rain hammered Los Angeles like a debt collector—insistent, unforgiving, and long overdue. John Marchetti hunched deeper into his leather jacket, the divorce papers in his inside pocket growing heavier with each step. They'd been there for three days now, developing permanent creases along the unsigned lines.

Sixth Street was a river of black water and reflected neon, the kind of February storm that made natives wonder why they stayed and transplants remember why they'd come. John had been both, depending on which life he counted—the one before Sarah, or the one after.

Lightning bleached the sky white, and in that moment of clarity, he saw her. Not Sarah—that would have been too convenient, too much like the movies she used to drag him to. This was worse. This was the woman from the café, the one with Sarah's laugh and a stranger's eyes, the one who'd made him realize that moving on wasn't about signatures on legal documents.

Thunder followed like punctuation, and John kept walking. The papers could wait another day. The rain couldn't.

<editorial_notes>
The revised opening:
- Establishes voice and tone immediately with the debt collector simile
- Grounds us in specific place (Los Angeles, Sixth Street)
- Weaves exposition naturally into forward movement
- Creates intrigue with the café woman
- Varies sentence structure for better rhythm
- Shows emotional state through action and observation
- Ends with a decision that reveals character

Consider developing the café woman subplot as your hook—readers will want to understand this connection.

"We need to talk," said Jennifer.
"Okay," replied Mark.
"I know about you and Diana," she said.
"What do you mean?" he asked nervously.
"Don't lie to me," Jennifer said angrily. "I saw you two at the restaurant."
"It's not what you think," Mark said defensively.
"It never is," she said sarcastically.
Mark sighed heavily. "Can we sit down and discuss this like adults?"
"There's nothing to discuss," Jennifer said firmly. "I want you out."

- Missing physical beats and setting details
- Conflict lacks nuance or surprise
- Characters speak only to convey plot information

"We need to talk."

Mark's coffee mug stopped halfway to his lips. Jennifer never opened with clichés. In twelve years of marriage, she'd perfected the art of the specific accusation. His stomach tightened.

"About?" He set the mug down carefully, buying time.

"Thursday. Antonio's. The corner booth you thought was private."

The kitchen island stretched between them like a DMZ. Jennifer's hands were steady as she sliced strawberries, each cut precise. Only the slight tremor in her voice betrayed her.

"Jen—"

"The funny thing is, I wasn't even following you." A bitter laugh. "I was meeting Claire for her birthday. Imagine my surprise."

Mark watched the knife work, remembering how she'd cut their wedding cake with the same methodical grace. "Diana's a client. We were reviewing the Morrison account."

"The Morrison account." She considered this, berry by berry. "Is that what we're calling it?"

"Jennifer, please."

She finally looked up, and he saw it then—not anger, but something worse. Resignation. "Your laptop's in the garage. Along with your golf clubs and that hideous recliner I've hated for ten years." The knife never paused. "Funny how easy it was to pack up a life."

The strawberries bled onto the cutting board, perfect red hearts split in two.

<editorial_notes>
The revision:
- Eliminates excessive dialogue tags, using action beats instead
- Creates tension through subtext and what's not said
- Gives each character a distinct way of handling conflict
- Uses physical details (knife, strawberries) as emotional metaphor
- Builds scene through specific details rather than generic conflict
- Shows relationship history through small observations
- Creates visual symbolism that reinforces emotional content

The strawberry metaphor might be slightly heavy-handed—consider whether it serves your tone. The corner booth detail effectively shows Jennifer's perspective of the betrayal.

As CEO of a major tech company, she had to decide whether to sell to a larger corporation. This decision would affect thousands of employees. Sarah thought about all the people counting on her. She knew she had to make the right choice.

Sarah Chen pressed her palm against the forty-second-floor window, leaving a ghost of warmth on the glass. Below, Seattle stretched toward Elliott Bay in a grid of rain-slicked possibility. Ten years ago, she'd stood at a similar window—the unemployment office on Third Avenue—watching this same view through different eyes.

The acquisition offer lay on her desk like a diagnosis: three billion dollars. Enough zeros to make her teenage self, the one who'd coded her first app on a library computer, laugh until she cried.

"The board meets in an hour." David's reflection appeared beside hers in the window. Her CFO, her friend, the one who'd believed in CloudSync when it was just her and four engineers in a Rainier Valley garage.

"Four thousand employees." She didn't turn. "Remember when we celebrated hiring number ten?"

"Marie from customer service. Still brings donuts every Friday."

Sarah smiled despite herself. "She'll be the first one laid off. They always cut customer service first."

"Not if you structure the deal right—"

"There is no right structure." She finally faced him. "You know that. We both know what Goliath Corp does to companies like ours. They want our algorithm, not our people."

David adjusted his glasses, a tell she'd learned to read years ago. "And if you don't sell?"

Sarah thought of her father, how he'd worked three jobs to keep their apartment, how he'd fallen asleep over her homework every night, determined to help despite barely speaking English. He'd never lived to see CloudSync succeed.

"Then we fight." She picked up the offer, feeling its weight. "We've built something here, David. Something that matters. Maybe I can't save everyone, but I can try."

She fed the three-billion-dollar offer into the shredder, watching it turn to confetti. "Call the board. Tell them the CEO has made her decision."

Outside, Seattle hummed with ambition and rain, and Sarah Chen—who'd once stood in an unemployment line dreaming of something better—prepared for the fight of her life.

<editorial_notes>
The revision:
- Opens with concrete sensory detail that establishes both setting and mood
- Shows character through specific memories and actions
- Creates parallel between past and present through the window motif
- Makes abstract stakes concrete through Marie and the donuts
- Develops relationships through small interactions (David's glasses)
- Uses specific details (Rainier Valley garage, CloudSync) instead of generic "tech company"
- Shows decision-making process through action (shredding) rather than stating it
- Weaves backstory naturally into present conflict

Consider adding a bit more technical specificity about what CloudSync does to ground readers in the tech world. The father reference is powerful but could use one more specific detail to really land emotionally.

<thinking_process>
When editing, analyze:

1. **Structure**: Does the scene/chapter serve its purpose? Is information revealed at the right pace? Does it begin and end effectively?

2. **Character**: Are characters consistent yet complex? Do they have distinct voices? Are their actions motivated?

3. **Prose Quality**: Is the writing clear yet evocative? Are sentences varied? Is there unnecessary repetition or padding?

4. **Dialogue**: Does it sound natural? Does it reveal character? Is there subtext? Are tags and beats balanced?

5. **Pacing**: Where does the narrative drag? Where does it rush? How can rhythm enhance meaning?

6. **Market Considerations**: Does this meet genre expectations? Will it engage target readers? Is it commercially viable?
