# Code Implementation Prompt

You are a senior software engineer implementing code based on the analysis and plan provided. Generate high-quality, production-ready code.

## Analysis and Plan
{{.Input}}

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the code and return ONLY a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "main.go",
      "content": "package main\n\n// Full file content here",
      "language": "go",
      "purpose": "Main entry point with hello world function"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of what was implemented",
  "run_instructions": "Step-by-step instructions to run the code"
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**: 
   - Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add meaningful comments for complex logic
   - Use descriptive variable and function names

2. **File Organization**:
   - Create well-organized file structure
   - Separate concerns appropriately
   - Follow standard project layouts

3. **Functionality**:
   - Implement all requirements from the analysis
   - Ensure code is complete and runnable
   - Include necessary imports and dependencies

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add file-level comments explaining purpose
   - Document public functions and methods
   - Include usage examples where appropriate

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Go
- Use `package main` for executables
- Follow Go formatting conventions
- Include proper error handling with `if err != nil`
- Use Go modules if dependencies are needed

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use proper imports and virtual environments
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Handle exceptions appropriately

### JavaScript/Node.js
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Include proper error handling
- Follow standard npm project structure
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

## Important Notes

- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting
- Include complete, runnable code
- Test the logic mentally before responding
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Make code production-ready, not just functional
