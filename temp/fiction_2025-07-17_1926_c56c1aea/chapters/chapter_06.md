# Chapter 6 (Expanded & Immersive)

Morty wasn’t sure if he was more awed or horrified watching Deadpool spin Rick’s portal gun around his fingers, treating it like a toy won at a carnival, instead of the volatile, universe-puncturing dynamite it actually was. The gun’s high-tech metal glinted beneath fluorescent shop lights, but Deadpool twirled it carelessly, whistling something vaguely circus-like.

“Uh, Deadpool? Maybe don’t point that at your—”

But it was already too late. Deadpool’s eyes creased gleefully behind his battered mask as he pulled the trigger without an ounce of caution. Morty braced himself for a mushroom cloud—or at least a screaming time loop—but instead, a gaudy paper flag shot out with a springy *pop*, unfurling to display a bright red *BANG*.

Deadpool crumpled with laughter, the sound sharp and infectious as it ricocheted around the garage packed with junk and glowing tech. “Classic! See, Morty? Timing is everything. Also, my face grows back if this goes bad, so hey—perks of the regeneration gig.”

Rick, face shadowed by the flicker of equipment and half-buried beneath glowing wire tangles and a fortress of empty snack bags, glared hard enough to etch glass. “Congratulations, moron. You probably just scared three timelines into self-canceling. *Give. It. Back*,” he snarled, voice crackling. “Or I’ll loop your lungs through your teeth in five dimensions and make you listen to every Taylor Swift breakup song at the same time.”

Deadpool relented, handing over the gun with a theatrical bow and a flourish. “Relax, Doc Brown—insurance doesn’t cover cross-reality hijinks. If things blow up, the worst they can do is recast me. And let’s be honest—nobody can afford my legal team.” His baby blues winked cheekily above the mask.

Morty edged closer to Rick’s workspace, feeling the faint, tingly hum of the portal generator vibrating against his knees. The table was littered with alien gadgets, spilled orange soda, and mysterious stains. The generator itself pulsed with uneasy blue and green strobes, casting shadows that wriggled at the corners of Morty’s eyes.

“Can we—um—maybe focus on not making the next big bad out of, like, the laws of the universe? Or narrative? Or whatever?” Morty stammered, wringing his hands together, the hairs on his arms prickling as the electric air got heavier.

Right on cue, as if the universe heard him and wanted to show off, a portal hiccupped open in the far corner. Static buzzed. With a comical squawk, a squeaky rubber chicken fired out like a bullet, smacking Deadpool right in the sternum. The abrupt sound was so out of place, Morty jumped; his heart pounded like a cartoon mallet in his chest.

Deadpool snatched up the chicken, brandishing it heroically. “The Weaponized Humor Taskforce is *assembled!*” he bellowed at the ceiling, then saluted his new sidekick. “Lieutenant Poultry, reporting for duty. Together, we’ll… uh… cross the road? Survive the punchline apocalypse?” He made a show of flexing the chicken’s wings, which let out a forlorn honk.

Rick’s eyes rolled skyward, long-suffering. Morty could practically hear the grind of spent patience; he wondered—not for the first time—if Rick ever wished for dull, predictable problems instead of the constant threat of narrative collapse. “You two are perfect *disaster bait*. The villain—the Over-Narrator—feeds on randomness, on awareness, on *cracks* in the fourth wall. Every dumb joke or winking aside just makes it stronger. So, shut up before we get Quickdraw McGraw-ed out of existence.”

Deadpool froze, chicken mid-chirp. Morty tried to swallow. He felt the chill settle over the garage—the lazy, jittery overhead lights started flickering harder, casting everything in a nauseous, shifting violet. For a second, even the world outside the grimy window seemed to hush; the air grew thick, swelling with static. Shadows stretched towards them, impossibly long and sinister.

“So… us being meta… It’s literally breaking everything? Like, un-writing the universe?” Morty croaked, his voice small and trembling. The realization made his stomach ache; he felt like he was standing two inches from a cliff he couldn’t see the bottom of.

“Bingo,” Rick muttered, fingers flying with nervous speed over a labyrinth of colored toggles and switches. He didn’t look up, but his jaw clenched like he was bracing for a punch. “It’s eating the story from the inside out. The more we *notice*, the more it feeds. The bigger it gets.” With a grimace, he twisted a dial—the generator whined, the blue-green lights stuttering into a warning red.

Deadpool clapped a red-sleeved hand onto Morty’s shoulder, his usual clowning dropped for one rare, lucid moment. “Look, kid. Sometimes jokes are the shield from the cosmic abyss. That’s my whole deal. But maybe—just maybe—it’s time for that ‘growth scene’ editors are always on about. Real feelings. Ugh. Gross, am I right?”

Morty felt the touch steady him, if only for a beat. He looked at Deadpool—really looked—and wondered what it must be like, hiding fear and pain beneath quips and chaos. Maybe Deadpool was right. Maybe they needed more than wisecracks to beat this thing.

Rick snorted, but Morty could see the tremor in his hands as he scavenged through a pile of gadgets, finally pulling out something that looked suspiciously like a melted toaster with wires grafted to it. “Feelings. Marvelous. Fine. Morty—grab the empathy capacitor out of the fridge. Wade—try not to decapitate the multiverse before I finish rebuilding it.”

Morty dashed for the fridge, skidding across slick patches of hot sauce and spilled portal fluid. The inside of the fridge glowed eerily, packed less with food and more with bubbling vials and metal cubes. He yanked out a gadget labeled “EMPATHY (HANDLE WITH CARE)” in Rick’s sharpie scrawl.

While Morty rooted around, Deadpool sidled closer to Rick. He twirled the rubber chicken, which squeaked in rhythm with the deepening hum of the portal generator. “Ever think this—that is, all of it: universe, story, everything—kind of runs on duct tape and bad puns? Like, we’re one lazy rewrite from total collapse?” His tone was lighter, but his eyes, beneath the mask, searched Rick’s for something like reassurance.

Rick sighed, the sound scraping the back of his throat. For a moment, Morty saw how exhausted he looked—every ounce of genius weighed down by years of running from existential threats. “Every day, Wade. Every damn day.”

The peace shattered. The portal device shrieked, high and furious, a banshee keen that set Morty’s teeth on edge. The lights overhead snapped ultraviolet and the whole desk vibrated like something monstrous was fighting through from the other side. Sparks danced across the clutter; reality warped around the generator, dragging shadows into wild, impossible shapes. Morty recoiled, heart pounding, the memory of the Chapter 1 warehouse flickering back—walls glitching out, the world almost erased.

“We’re running out of script, people!” barked Rick. His voice was sharp as acid, but there was a thread of hope—the desperate, stubborn hope that maybe, somehow, this was the chapter they’d survive.

Deadpool squared up, voice dropping into rare seriousness—a line of steel under the absurdity. “Guess this is it. Let’s see if sincerity really is the ultimate plot twist.”

Light shattered across them, spilling green and violet like spilled paint and swallowing the garage whole. Morty squeezed the empathy capacitor to his chest. Then, together, they stepped through the shattered portal—leaving behind the familiar chaos, no clue what waited on the other side, only the hope that a new kind of story could begin.
