# Chapter 1

Deadpool crashed through the warehouse window, glass raining behind him like the world’s most dysfunctional confetti cannon. He hit the ground rolling—Tuesdays, or as he called them, “Carnage and Chimichangas Day.”

Inside, the mobsters erupted—guns waving, panic spreading across their greasy faces as they scrambled for cover. Bullets shattered the silence, ricocheting through crates and shadows.

Deadpool popped upright and, with mock dignity, brushed glass off his suit. “Gentlemen! I do appreciate your impromptu bullet ballet, but I forgot my tutu. Again. Budget cuts, you know?”

“Get him!” snarled a thug, chin forested by mutton chops thick enough to muff out the mob’s sense of style.

Gunfire exploded. Deadpool pirouetted away, all caffeinated grace and manic energy, landing behind a stack of barrels. He tossed a wink to—you? Or maybe just to the weary security camera sagging in the corner. Meta-wink: achieved.

With a flourish, he drew his katanas. “All right, boys. PG-13 violence only!” He paused, head cocked. “Wait, just checking—this isn’t Disney+, right? Eh. Screw it.” 

He vaulted the barrels, slicing gun barrels, disarming thugs, and drop-kicking a pistol across the cement. Mayhem, but with style.

Mutton Chops barreled at him, crowbar flailing, eyes gleaming cartoon-crazy. Deadpool smoothly sidestepped, caught the guy’s arm, stage-whispered, “Sorry, buddy. Crowbars are for plumbers and under-qualified jesters,” and hurled him into a stack of counterfeit CDs labeled “Best of Smash Mouth: Platinum Edition.” Plastic erupted in a discordant crash.

Somewhere, a cellphone buzzed to life, “All Star” blaring its tinny chorus. Couldn’t make this up. Deadpool snatched a dropped pistol (inventory management, people), and plucked up the phone.

“Deadpool speaking! If you’re selling car warranties press one, if you’re an interdimensional warlord press two. Hold up—what?”

Static. The phone sparked, fizzed, and for a split second, the air around him glitched like a banged-up VHS tape. Walls warped, then snapped clear. Deadpool stared at the phone.

“That wasn’t in the script.” He addressed…air? You? “If I randomly turn into a magical anime girl, blame editorial.”

He edged forward. The air sizzled again—a sound he’d only later recognize, when the multiverse really started breaking. Silence reasserted itself with a stubborn hum.

Still, recovery was Deadpool’s middle name. He bounded up, twin katanas at the ready, and swept the room. “Greetings, illegal tax evaders!” he cheered, waggling gloved fingers. Around him, six mobsters blinked, confusion thick as their aftershave.

“Who the hell—?” barked one in pinstripes (Pinstripe: classic, always a bingo square).

Deadpool spun his swords lazily, unworried about pistols being nervously re-aimed. “Who am I? Just your friendly, fourth-wall-breaking, chimichanga enthusiast. Licensed antihero—sometimes a pony. Licensing’s flexible.” Another wink at the battered security camera. Its red light flickered—respect, machines.

Bullets screeched. Deadpool weaved between crates, lead chewing new holes in dead wallpaper. “Come on, Tony! Couldn’t spring for higher-ranked henchmen? What is this, the Dollar Store of Evil?” A bullet grazed his shoulder. He clutched his wound, feigning shock. “Not the meat-shoulder! It carries all my emotional trauma.”

He vaulted a crate, landing beside a trembling thug whose gun clattered to the ground. “Hey, nervous? Don’t worry, sharing a scene with me is only fatal to your dignity.” He tapped the man’s jaw—soft, but just enough to send him down for a nap.

Suddenly, a heavier round tore through a crate. Deadpool ducked, landing face-first in a heap of questionable electronics. Grabbing a walkie-talkie, he pressed the button with his chin. “Deadpool here. Mobsters: one. Deadpool: a million. Accepting henchman applications. Must bring snacks.”

He pushed upright as Pinstripe leveled a rocket launcher, grinning like a game show host. “Oh, loot drop! Someone’s compensating.” Deadpool lined up his katanas, never missing a comedic beat.

Pinstripe fired, barrel belching smoke.

Deadpool winked at—well, the nearest metaphorical camera. “Ground rules: you all shoot, miss spectacularly, and I get to be the star. Capisce?” He spun his blades, steel whispering through the air (with just a dash of sleep deprivation).

The mobsters exchanged glances. The burliest—butterfly tattoo fluttering on his neck, eyes wide—growled, “Just shoot him!”

Gunfire swallowed the room. Deadpool darted behind a mangled slot machine, its chrome now battered and bruised. “Watch the rental! Murder fees kill the deposit.” He stabbed a sword sideways, tripping a goon, who flipped into a table of cold shrimp. “Complimentary shrimp, my dude!”

He hopped over the slot machine, somersaulted, and struck feet-first into another thug’s chest. The man collapsed. Deadpool landed next to him and counted off: “One down, five to go! Or six, if we’re counting my inner child. Poor kid never survived the flashbacks.”

A third mobster lunged, pool cue swinging like he was auditioning for community theater. Deadpool ducked. The cue whooshed by. “Wrong genre, Jimmy Two-Sticks.” He snapped the cue over his knee and jabbed the splintered end into the man’s waistband. The thug yelped, staggering into a heap of neon-orange Cheetos. (Note to self: never trust pool cues.)

Glass shattered above. “Ceasefire brunch, anyone?” Deadpool sing-songed, backflipping over toppled chafing trays, katanas flickering. With a quick move, he yanked a pistol from another thug and tossed it into a planter. “This is why we can’t have nice things. Or foliage.”

He paused, chest heaving, manic smile plastered beneath the mask. Around him, the last mobsters circled, not sure if they should fire or flee. Deadpool twirled his blades, eyes wild. “Well? Who’s next? Don’t be shy—I don’t bite. Unless the plot demands it.”

As though on cue, the lights overhead flickered—a subtle warning, then a deep, ominous pulse. Somewhere far away, reality flexed a knuckle. The night shuddered, preparing to break.

**[End of Chapter 1]**

*Foreshadowing Threads*:  
The odd glitch sets up the coming multiversal chaos and Rick’s arrival; Deadpool’s references to “the script” and “editorial” prep his deepening meta-awareness; callbacks to brunch, cheap thugs, and pool cues tie in his history and hint at the impending, reality-bending mess.

- **Dialogue:** Sharper, more direct exchanges, extra Deadpool-isms, and banter that underscores chaos.  
- **Action/Description:** Brief but vivid; action never interrupts the flow, description is always purposeful, and asides drive character and pace.
