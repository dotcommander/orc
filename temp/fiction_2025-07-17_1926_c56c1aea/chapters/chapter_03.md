# Chapter 3

Deadpool peered over a jagged crate, katanas balanced across his shoulders. The warehouse’s busted lights flickered over the latest carnage. Before the dust could settle, another squad of intruders stomped in—black suits, faces fuzzed like reality stopped rendering them. Their sleeves bore a “Generic Multiversal Goons Local 399” patch—more branding than Deadpool ever got.

He couldn’t help himself: “Nice matching jackets! Corporate retreat, or the deadliest family reunion since Succession?” He dove as gunfire bit out, bullets pinging off glass.

“Drop the device!” one goon ordered. “Hand over the dimensional whatsit and nobody gets recycled into a plot hole!”

Deadpool froze, indignant. “Dimensional whatsit? Specify! I’ve got three whatsits in here.” He rummaged—producing a rubber chicken, a half-eaten chimichanga, and a blinking cube like a Rubik’s Cube on gamma steroids. He juggled it.

“That’s it! Get—wait, do we use ‘he’ or ‘she’ here?” another goon asked, re-aiming.

Deadpool gasped beneath his mask. “Excuse you, it’s Pool/X now. Does this thing get WiFi or just wreck universes?” He grinned, flipping the device.

No answer. Deadpool hurled a barrel. More shots. He vaulted onto a ruined shelf, pistols blazing, brass falling. A henchman lunged; Deadpool kicked out his feet, sent him flying. Another swung a baton—Deadpool twirled it away.

“Participation trophies for everyone! Interpretive dance gets full starfish.”

Reality hiccupped—a portal burst open, spattering green light. Rick stumbled out, flask and portal gun in hand, lab coat askew. Morty tumbled after, wide-eyed, landing in Deadpool’s space.

Rick took stock. “Great. ‘Reservoir Dogs, but worse.’ So which one’s Mr. Nuisance?”

Deadpool swept a bow. “Welcome to Wendy’s! Delivery guys get eaten first.”

Morty cracked, voice high: “R-Rick, didn’t you promise no more warehouses full of—” A shot pinged. “—THIS?”

“Infinite universes, Morty. Infinite warehouses. Should’ve read the fine print.” Rick sipped, annoyed.

The portal fizzled shut, stranding them—goons, Deadpool, and all—in close company. Every henchman wore a tag: “Generic Multiversal Henchman #XXX.” None looked thrilled.

Deadpool thumbed at the group. “They get name tags? I can’t even get hazard pay!”

Lead goon droned: “Union’s expendable, economical, and threateningly vague, sir. HR complaints to the Harbingers of Reality.”

Rick snorted. “Morty, if bullets start, hide behind your existential fear. It’s thicker than Kevlar by now.”

Morty ducked behind a crate. “That’s not—ugh, fine.”

The guns went off. Rick twisted his portal gun, slamming it down. A wavering green shield snapped up, bullets ricocheting, air warping.

Deadpool whooped, vaulting cover, swords whirling as he lopped a plastic rifle; the goon flickered, programming glitching.

“Hey, union boss!” Deadpool crowed. “You upcharge for workplace injuries?”

Lead goon deadpanned, “Damage comes out of your dimension’s budget. Watch for the invoice.”

Morty cowered, eyes darting to warping shadows as if the corners would bite. Rick, crouched behind the field, surveyed the mess. “Change of plan: improvise! Blame causality if it fails.”

Deadpool grinned. “Improvise was my high school superlative. I’m all in, Doc.”

Morty whimpered, “Can’t we just portal out?!”

Rick barked, “Morty, comic relief. Deadpool, distraction. Move!”

Deadpool saluted, letting moonlight hit his swords. “Team Dysfunction, assemble!”

He dove in, katanas flashing. Henchmen pressed in, edges blurring; one clipped Deadpool’s arm with a baton. He spun, countered, and the goon popped like glitchy code—sparks, a few pixels, then nothing.

Behind crates, Morty cowered, muttering about dystopian job fairs built on despair. Deadpool flopped beside him, blood spattering his boots.

“Kid, existential dread is just emotional background noise. Teamwork means dodging bullets together.” He caught a flicker in the shadows—same cold prickle as that first glitch—trailing down his neck.

Rick was already digging through debris. There: blinking, the “dimensional doohickey.” It pulsed, plastered in Rick’s frantic stickers: “DO NOT PRESS. Narrative Hazard.”

Instantly, Deadpool was there, poking it. “Is this the moment the plot advances? If not, I’ll break into song. Nobody wants that.”

Rick yanked the device away. “Touch that and the multiverse implodes, just like your self-control. Trust me.”

Morty hovered uncertainly in the green glow. “Rick, let’s just use it. This place feels… wrong. Like we’ll get deleted for meta-jokes.”

Rick studied him—almost soft—then glanced at Deadpool and the twitching shadows. “Everyone gets weird about plot holes eventually. Speaking of—Deadpool, weirdest thing you’ve survived?”

Deadpool leaned against a crate, voice cocky but tired. “In-universe? Multiple reboots and heartbreaks. Outside? I fell into a reality glitch, came out a Funko Pop. Don’t recommend.”

Rick cracked half a smile. “Survival’s a bad habit. Stand by—I’ll fix this before reality eats us.”

As Rick tinkered, the shadows on the edge twitched—glitching, deliberate. The air flickered, world waiting for a punchline. Deadpool shivered. Even Morty tried not to see the seams warping.
