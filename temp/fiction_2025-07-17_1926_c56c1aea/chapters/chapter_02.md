# Chapter 2

Deadpool zipped behind a stack of conveniently placed crates—seriously, did these warehouses buy them wholesale?—his red suit just a blur in the industrial gloom. Stale oil tainted the air. Bullets rattled past with metallic shrieks, chewing through sheet metal and embedding themselves in boxes whose origins he didn’t want to question. Something vaguely fishy and definitely expired scented the drifting air. A takeout menu fluttered down in front of his mask, a white flag of surrender from last night’s General Tso’s.

"Nice grouping!" Deadpool called out, popping up like the world’s most violent meerkat to return fire, his semi-automatic chattering. His shots sprayed wide—deliberately, of course. He shrugged mid-spray. "Guess I’m saving my aim for the video game adaptation!"

"I don’t think the Globetrotters use guns, man!" one thug shouted, voice cracking as he clutched his Uzi chest-high like a teddy bear with live ammo—about as stable and just as soaked at the pits.

Deadpool slid behind a crate marked “Parts: Some Assembly Required.” He diced up options in his head like a chef on a cooking show no one watched. "Let’s see… three stooges left: one lurking behind Chekhov’s suspiciously ominous gun box, one auditioning for Crime Scene: Face-Plant Edition, and one clutching bullet wounds with that faraway look of ‘I regret my entire resume.’ Classic."

Just then, a goon swung a pipe at Deadpool’s head—pretty sure it was a water main, technically. It whiffed by a mile, hiss of metal on empty air. Deadpool spun, brained him with the butt of his pistol, and the pipe clanged to the floor. "That’s improvisational theater. Tony would clap if he were conscious!"

Gunman Two—a scruffy guy who looked part-time pizza delivery, full-time disaster—charged. He skidded on a puddle of spilled lo mein, windmilled, and crashed into a tower of fortune cookies. Tiny slips of paper tumbled in golden drift. Deadpool snatched one from mid-air, split it open with his thumb. “Your future holds… severe cranial swelling. Lucky numbers: None.”

The third thug, shaking hands barely clutching his weapon, tried to aim. Deadpool smiled under his mask—he never could resist a film reference. “You ever see The Matrix?” He flicked the pistol aside, leaned in, and finger-gunned the guy. “Dodge this.” One gentle bop to the forehead and the thug crumpled, gun clattering after him.

Silence dropped, thick as syrup. Spent shells tinkled onto ruined linoleum. Fluorescent lights overhead hummed and buzzed, lending the scene a headachey glow. Deadpool dusted concrete grit from his gloves with existential flair.

Above, a harsh, distorted voice barked down from a balcony: "Get him! Boss wants him alive!"

Deadpool sighed, loud for the echo. "Alive? Ugh, boring directive. Does he want me in one piece or, like, Jackson Pollock style? No one’s ever specific about these things." He pivoted, vaulting off a crate with a leap and a slash. His sword bisected a pistol; the thug holding it nearly dropped their lower jaw, staring at the neatly ruined halves like he was waiting for a pop-up repair menu.

“Warranty doesn't cover antihero incidents!" Deadpool trilled, landing before a crate that—because of course—exploded outward in a squall of rubber chickens. A squelch, a comedic slip, and a shower of red, blue, yellow plastics. Deadpool blinked rapidly. Once. Twice. Forty-seven. "Either I’ve ascended to slapstick Valhalla or their prop guy has ADHD…and access to Amazon Prime."

A goon in a track jacket lunged, shrieking. Deadpool volleyed a chicken into his face, giggling, "FOWL play! If that gets old, folks, blame the writers!" Another thug rushed in, only to be impaled—via sleeve—into the sheet metal. “Stick around! Wait, wrong franchise. Please don’t sue!”

Heavy, shimmery static shocked his earpiece—sharp as paper cuts. A nasal, high-strung voice came through: “Hey, spandex! Drag yourself to Bay 4 before your jokes give me an aneurysm.”

Deadpool cocked his head—kept his guns ready. “Cosmic script supervisor? Or my therapist pretending to be a Bond villain again?” Gunfire chewed a line in the concrete, forcing Deadpool into a baseball slide behind a forklift that reeked of diesel and regret.

Lights flickered, shadows swimming like goldfish along the walls. Deadpool’s brow furrowed behind his mask. “That weird glitch again… haunted-IKEA vibes. Leave it to me to get stuck in the one warehouse with ghosts and surplus ducks.”

Above, one last stooge ditched his gun and his dignity, bolting for the nearest emergency exit. Deadpool considered calling out helpful escape tips, but figured Darwin had it handled.

He peeled a rubber chicken off his shoulder, tiptoed with exaggerated stealth toward the Bay 4 sign’s flickering neon. Smelled like burned coffee and colder ambition. “Onward, to the next plot device,” he whispered grandly, disappearing into the semi-darkness in a rustle of poultry and bravado.

A bullet whizzed by inches from his mask, splintering a crate with a wet thunk. The wooden scent mixed with ozone and cordite. "Hey! That was my good side!" Deadpool called, springing up to the crate’s top. “Gentlemen, before my spleen files for relocation, have you ever considered unionizing? Dental plans! Life insurance! Maybe a ‘fatality clause’—very practical!”

The ragged survivors paused, blinking, as deadly earnestness seeped into their faces.

“Shut up, freak, or—” one tried, but his threat got preempted by Deadpool's twin katanas pinning his sleeves to the corrugated wall. “Hands up! Or… sleeves. Whatever you’ve got, it’s up now.”

Deadpool landed beside a crate stamped "Handle With Exposition." He rapped it twice. “So—who’s hiding the MacGuffin? Help me out and, hey, maybe your spleens get to stay inside instead of, y’know, reupholstering the ceiling.”

A quaking thug whimpered, eyes saucer-wide. “We don’t know, man! Some scientist hired us just to stand watch. Lab coats, weird smells, real antisocial vibe!”

Deadpool squinted. “Scientist. Right. Paunch, social skills last updated in ’98, lives on vending machine snacks—picture’s getting clearer.”

A siren howled outside. Then—above—a high, fracturing crack ripped the air. Blue light lanced through, jagged, pulsing, glitchy as a ruined smartphone. Deadpool froze, palm on the crate.

"Oh, COME ON," he groaned, sagging. "I just got this suit back from the cleaners!"

From the tear in reality, a battered, boxy device—somewhere between a car battery and a shoe, trailing an improbable mess of fries and plastic soda bottles—tumbled out onto the warehouse floor, thundering amidst bouncing rubber chickens. Ozone spiked the air, mingling with a whiff of cheap cologne and interdimensional burnout.

A startled voice from inside the contraption: “Uh... Rick? Where the heck are we? And who’s this guy in the red pajamas?”

Deadpool’s eyes ping-ponged with delight, then narrowed slyly in recognition. A grin stretched under his mask, crows’ feet bunching. “Oh, terrific. New players, portal tech, and just enough dysfunction to fill three seasons and a Christmas special. I know this show...”

He sauntered toward the pileup, katanas spinning. Another rubber chicken defied gravity, bounced off his boot like a punctuation mark.

Behind him, lights flickered again—reality skipping like a scratched record, colors glitching at the edges, as if even the universe wanted to know what happened next.
