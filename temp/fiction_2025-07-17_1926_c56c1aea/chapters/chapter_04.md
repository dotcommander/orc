# Chapter 4

Morty stared, open-mouthed, as Deadpool vaulted onto the battered Smith kitchen counter, splashing down in a mystery puddle that might once have been orange juice. “All right, multiverse breakfast assembly!” Deadpool crowed, arms thrown wide like a caffeinated game show host. “Rule one: ricochets encouraged. Rule two: say ‘what could possibly go wrong’ and you win a surprise wedgie!” His sword spun dangerously, beheading a salt shaker and narrowly missing a plastic dinosaur.

Rick leaned against the fridge, beer in hand, eyebrows knitting. “Wade, there’s no way I’m chasing infinity stones or quantum… sporks… or even coupons with a cosplaying narcissist who monologues like his own private radio drama.”

“Aw, c’mon, Rick!” Morty stammered, nerves spiking. “At least he, uh, gets chaos. That’s like… your thing, right?”

Deadpool dropped beside Morty, grinning through gunpowder haze and residual taco fumes. “Morty understands. We’ve both toured more universes than a copyright lawyer. Step one—more explosions, fewer catastrophic glitches this time.”

Rick eyed the heap of fried circuitry on the counter—his busted portal gun. “Here’s the only plan: track down whoever’s stitching realities together before the multiverse collapses like a bad sequel. And Wade, every time you talk, another universe flatlines.”

Deadpool shrugged, jazz hands flashing. “What can I say? If we want to stop Mister Mimesis from turning everything into a TikTok disaster, we need teamwork!” He saluted with both swords, then immediately lost interest.

“Trust fall and I’ll turn you into shelf stable sausage,” Rick muttered.

Morty watched, eyes flickering between awe and dread. “Can we just... come up with a plan that isn’t a trust exercise or, uh, improv comedy?”

“Step one,” Rick recited, deadpan, “don’t trust Deadpool. Step two, repeat step one.”

Deadpool grinned. “Killjoy! Fine. Pool gadgets, don matching jumpsuits, out-meta the meta. I call it—branding!” He seized a battered spatula, waving it overhead.

Rick snorted, but his mouth twitched.

Breakfast went on in distorted sitcom rhythm: Deadpool spun atop the counter, spatula aloft, addressing an invisible laugh track. Rick rummaged through the fridge, wary. Summer, pajama-clad and unimpressed, poured cereal and glared with enough venom to sterilize a planet.

“Wade, off the counter,” Rick growled.

Deadpool stepped down, tossing the spatula onto a pile of mail. “Just adding sparkle! If breakfast survives, so can the multiverse.”

Morty frowned, trying to stay focused. “So…what *is* the plan?”

Rick dumped unidentifiable ketchup into a bubbling beaker. “Plan: evacuate before Mister Mimesis turns this joint into a plot hole. And if you make it worse, Wade, you’re paying for therapy.”

Deadpool slid down with a superhero pose, cape-less but definite. “I say ‘plot potato,’ you say ‘world-ending baked spud.’ But fine—step one, distract the bad guy with breakfast puns. Step two, improvise. Step three: never trust the writers.”

He paused, then added, “And rename every timeline ‘Earth-Deadpool-Prime’—SEO, baby.”

A flicker—purple static shimmered in the kitchen’s corner, coughs of electricity popping off the linoleum. A portal began to hiss open.

Everyone froze. Rick barely looked up. “Great. Even reality’s lagging.”

Deadpool grabbed the spatula. “Change of venue, gang! Next stop: wherever that spits us out. Hopefully, not inside a burrito.” He motioned grandly, but Morty and Summer instinctively edged away.

“Is he *always* like this?” Morty muttered, voice thin.

“Worse,” Summer replied, cereal in mouth. “Mom said never make eye contact.”

Rick yanked a glowing bottle from the fridge and jabbed a finger at Wade. “If you’re going to trash my kitchen, make yourself useful. Know how to cook eggs in six realities?”

Deadpool grinned, scooping three eggs. He flipped one, slashed another in half with a katana, and let the third explode perfectly onto Jerry’s shirt as Jerry peeked in, visibly crumbling. “Not again, not again…”

Ignoring the mess, Deadpool cracked his knuckles. “Orientation time: Evil’s ripped the fourth wall. Continuity errors and angry fanfics are pouring in. Sound familiar?” He glanced at Rick.

Rick’s gaze turned razor-sharp. “Someone weaponized meta-humor. Again.”

Deadpool solemnly pressed the spatula to his chest. “We have to out-meta the meta before the audience swaps over to *Family Guy*.”

Morty shivered, remembering that earlier warehouse glitch—like déjà vu with teeth. “So…we save the multiverse?”

Deadpool was already nodding. “Rescue reality, autograph it, and absolutely, definitely—tacos after.”

Groaning, Summer rolled her eyes. “All this before coffee. Incredible.”

For once, Rick almost smiled—something flaring in his eyes. “Alright. Garage raid. You three, prep for whatever that portal spews out, and nobody eat anything that talks back.”

The kitchen, packed with static and nerves, seemed to thrum. As Deadpool leapt down, spatula raised, Rick’s family—plus their reality-breaking squatter—braced to charge through the unknown. Morty’s nerves twisted, but anticipation rose as the portal widened, the edges of their world thickening and burning like melting celluloid.

Rick tipped back his beer, flung the can into the portal, and smirked. “Let’s go ruin someone else’s morning.”

Somewhere, reality gave a nervous twitch. And Mister Mimesis smiled, waiting.

**Notes:**  
- Pacing keeps momentum by moving briskly between beats, rarely lingering on asides or jokes for too long.  
- Dialogue snappier, with quick back-and-forths that reveal character and up the tension—everyone’s reactions are clear and moving the plot forward.  
- Action is interspersed with (not overwhelmed by) jokes and description; goofy bits never slow the approach of the crisis.  
- Transitions from character beats to events (the portal, etc) are seamless; the kitchen feels like a continuous, building prelude to action.  
- Chapter ends on a moment of movement and anticipation—a literal and figurative threshold.
