# Chapter 20

Deadpool inched down the warped staircase, boots tapping three different surfaces—cracked marble, sticky linoleum, and shag carpet so matted it nearly swallowed his left heel. “Why do abandoned lairs always look like fallout shelters designed by disgruntled interior decorators?” he muttered.

Behind him, Rick stalked warily, portals fizzing in his wake, ray gun at the ready. Morty trailed, clinging white-fisted to the rail, trembling like he’d just read the spoilers for every possible universe.

“Anyone else smell comic book glue and canceled reboots?” Deadpool stage-whispered.

Rick didn’t even look up. “That’s narrative entropy, dipstick—or Morty’s terror sweat. Odds say both.” He glanced over his shoulder, mouth curled in a sneer that almost covered his anxiety.

Morty hugged the banister harder. “Can we not talk about my bodily functions? Or how we’re about to die? Or—nopity nope—the wallpaper.” Ahead, the stairwell’s walls flickered with ghostly images: a grayscale Deadpool cutting through panel gutters; Rick and Morty chased by tentacled lawyers; a chimichanga floating by, forever out of reach.

Suddenly, reality peeled sideways. Dr. Panopticon dripped from a ragged gash in the air—cloak swirling with TV static, meme faces, and hashtags flickering in and out of existence. “Welcome, punchlines,” he chimed, voice echoing like a broken laugh track, “Right on cue.”

Deadpool unsheathed his katanas, blades fractaling through color gradients. “Oh great, the villain’s here. At least you smell better than the FanFic forums, Panopticon.”

Rick cocked his ray gun. “Spare the monologue, Four-Eyes. I see one more pun, and I melt you down into Funko Pops.”

Panopticon grinned, his mouth morphing like a TikTok filter. “You still think you’re the protagonists. When I break the narrative, all stories become punchlines without jokes. And me? I’ll be the final meme.” His shadow spilled down the stairs, slapping neon labels onto each step: “Chekhov’s Gun: Assembly Required”, “Foreshadowing Zone: Caution”, “Insert Flashback Here.”

Morty gagged. “Guys? Please don’t let me fall through a plot hole. Or into a meme.”

Deadpool winked at Morty, the reader, and probably the security system. “Plot holes build character, kid. Or sequels. Either way, embrace the vertigo!” With a flourish, he lunged at Panopticon’s shadow, swords flashing as Rick thumbed a switch on his gun, blue light strobing up the stairwell. Panopticon’s laughter glitched between surround sound and 8-bit, and then—snap—reality shuddered.

A breathless blackout.

When sensation returned, the stairwell kept flickering—new landings, wild color palettes, a universe where everyone was just…socks. Morty dry-heaved. “Why does it feel like I’m gonna throw up in three timelines at once?”

“Multiversal travel,” Deadpool grinned. “Keep arms, legs, and existential crises inside the ride at all times. If you see a version of yourself with a mustache, don’t trust him. Classic Evil Morty move.”

Rick scowled as the walls rippled, sitcom sets disintegrating into comic panels and back again. “Meta-oscillator’s close,” he growled. “Fourth wall’s bleeding out, physics are optional, and we’re wading through discarded plot threads. Hope you’re all up to date on your trope shots.”

A framed painting blinked twice, rolled its eyes. “Still with the fourth wall jokes?” it groaned. “Subtlety died three chapters ago.” Deadpool saluted. “RIP, subtlety. Killed by editorial in Chapter Fourteen.”

Morty yelped as a stair melted into a trampoline; cartoon punctuation rained down. “Is this what self-awareness feels like? I hate it! Except maybe that time with Mr. Poopybutthole. Mostly hate.”

Rick yanked him back. “Ride it out, Morty. First rule of breaking reality: never slow down. Second rule: don’t acknowledge the camera.”

He glanced at Deadpool. “If we overload the meta-oscillator and someone gets too clever, the universe improvises itself into a black hole. And dying in a deleted scene? Trust me, it’s worse than it sounds.”

Deadpool clapped, fingers jittery. “Alright, final boss round! Who’s got repressed trauma? Winner gets to monologue at the afterparty.”

Without warning, a door appeared at the top landing, plaque gleaming: “No Plot Armor Beyond This Point.” Deadpool paused, mock-saluting. Rick swore softly, Morty whimpered, and the air tasted suddenly of static and stage fright.

Deadpool’s suit glitched, shifting between red-black geometry and flickering Polaroids of every fight they’d survived. “Heads up, Morty: If you hurl on my boots, your next codename’s Chunder Lad.”

Morty scowled through the nausea. “Dude, I think my soul is carsick. Just let me have this.”

The staircase convulsed, passing through checkerboards, static fuzz, patches of impossible grass. Paintings of Schrödinger’s cats meowed as the trio passed, eyes kaleidoscoping with possibility.

Deadpool jazz-handed his way forward. “Nothing like a breezy stroll to save existence. Hallucinating artwork, quantum cats, Morty inventing phobias—just your average Tuesday.” He paused at a busted “EXIT” sign—callback to their first team-up and the closest they’d ever come to a plan.

Morty’s voice was a thread. “Why does everything feel…thinner? Like reality’s running out of…pixels?”

Rick’s sneer wavered into worry. “Because it is. Physics only work if the script remembers them. We hit the core, and maybe—just maybe—someone gets a happy ending.” He glanced at Deadpool, whose one-eyed grin flickered beneath a shadow of grief: old friends, lost writers, stories left unfinished.

“Best case, we traumatize a new generation of fans,” Deadpool shrugged. “Worst case? Group hug.”

Rick grunted. “You try it, I shoot you twice.”

They crowded at the final door: cartoons speech bubbles warped across the wood, echoing their best and worst lines. Deadpool offered his hand. His friends hesitated, then reached out.

“Alright, weirdos. Showtime.”

He pushed the door. A flood of light and static yanked them in. Somewhere in the howling chaos of meta-reality, the final act waited.
