# Chapter 5 (Pacing & Flow Enhanced)

Morty hovered in the doorway, clutching a cereal box like body armor. “Are you, um, really Deadpool? Not some shapeshifter or, I dunno, Cronenberg thing pretending—”

Deadpool instantly vaulted onto a kitchen stool, bowing with theatrical flair. “One hundred percent original recipe: certified red suit, premium snark, and six universes’ worth of flagged Wikipedia edits. If I was a shapeshifter, trust me, I’d spring for the Ryan Reynolds model—abs and all. Copyright pending.”

Summer didn’t bother looking up from her phone, only sighed the sigh of someone who’d seen everything and cared about none of it. “Great, another deranged cosplayer. Try not to bleed on my homework.”

Rick slammed the fridge. “Alternate reality weirdos in my kitchen? That’s a Wednesday, kid. I just wish they’d buy a mug from the gift shop.” He poured questionable ‘milk’ into a cracked mug, topped it with straight vodka, stirred with his middle finger.

Deadpool sidled over, wrinkling his nose. “Your beverage bouquet, Rick—subtle tones of dread with a hint of…magic marker fumes?”

Rick sipped, unfazed, and fired a blue zapper at Deadpool’s hand. “Try anything, and I’ll make you the poster boy for OSHA violations.”

Morty edged in, setting cereal on the table like a peace offering. “Does this mean we’re in universe-ending danger, or is this just another Deadpool drop-in? Last time we had a portal, Dad was stuck as spaghetti for a month.”

Deadpool flashed finger guns, deadpan. “Bit of both, Morty! But heads up—if a guy in a plot-hole cape shows up, run. Or protect your collectibles.”

Summer, still scrolling, scowled. “Just don’t break anything. Including my straightener.”

Rick tossed the milk carton away. “Too late for that. Deadpool’s leaking meta-jokes all over my lifework.”

Deadpool hopped up on a chair, swinging his legs. “Hey, try holding in this much meta. You’ll pop something.”

The Smiths exchanged a unified, resigned glare. This breakfast was doomed.

Unfazed, Deadpool sprawled on Rick’s battered couch, boots crunching into old pizza crusts. “Place smells like microwaved dread.” He snatched Morty’s cereal, inspecting it. “Darker than my origin story, Morty. Is everything in this universe made of disappointment, or just breakfast?”

Morty backed up. “Honestly, I’ll take disappointment over interdimensional body-swapping, but—neither of you starts shooting, right?”

Deadpool cheerfully: “Only if things get really boring!”

Rick trudged back in, clutching a flask and a very irate, one-eyed rat. “Ignore Morty. He’s only dramatic before noon.” The rat skittered away, dropping a tiny monocle and muttering about union dues.

Deadpool flipped upside down over the couch armrest. “By the way, Rick: did your portal gun always make that wheezy noise, or did I break the meta-fourth wall so hard it’s got allergies?”

Rick groaned, spine popping as he plopped beside Deadpool. “You fried my portal gun with your ‘warehouse reality glitch’ escapade last chapter. Now it hacks up genre tropes every time I use it. Next time, try subtlety.” He drained his flask.

Summer glared from the hall. “If the universe melts again, I’m blaming you, Grandpa.”

Morty wrung his hands. “So… plan? Please tell me there’s a plan. ‘Wing it’ always goes sideways. Hands instead of spoons, remember?”

Deadpool swept his arms wide. “Plans are for people who think they have agency, Morty! All I bring is snacks and style.”

He winked at the ceiling—no, past it, at us. “Or maybe just at whoever’s punching keys upstairs. Hi, author!”

Rick rolled his eyes, digging out his battered portal gun. “Let’s break something before breakfast. Maybe reality, maybe just your patience.”

Deadpool grabbed a garish blaster from the table. “Nice tech, Rick. Is it set to ‘Swiss cheese’ or ‘existential dread’?”

Rick snatched it back. “Touch that again and you’ll spend an eternity hosting toddler karaoke.”

Morty peeked from behind a stack of radioactive VHS tapes. “Can someone please just make a plan?”

Deadpool beamed. “Planning is great—until a villain shows up two scenes early. Besides, do we even know what’s coming? Evil twins? Reality glitches? Or, even worse—network notes.”

Rick belched, the coffee table sizzling. “The only thing worse would be a CW crossover. Morty, find the portal gun that isn’t having a nervous breakdown. Deadpool, stay away from my gadgets.”

Deadpool tossed the gun back to Rick with a shrug. “Worst case, we spend three hours as living product placements.”

Morty rummaged and, victorious, held up a blinking portal gun. “Got it! I think.”

For a moment, everything held its breath. Deadpool’s tone shifted, suddenly sincere—pitched as much to the reader as to the room: “Ever get the feeling it’s just: ‘grab the doodad, save the universe’? Who’s writing this, anyway?” The air buzzed—not just tech, but something deeper, like the edges of the scene were flickering.

Rick was already prepping the portal gun, unfazed. “Let’s get this over with. Grab the snacks. Deadpool, backup or wild card—pick a side.”

Deadpool struck a kung-fu pose. “Montage time, right? Cue the heist music! But if the universe grows a musical number, I claim plausible deniability.”

They exchanged wary glances—the kind you share before the world flips upside down.

Something flickered—a hairline crack across the air, vanishing before anyone could blink.

The portal gun whirred, hungry.

A breathless beat—the calm before the cataclysm.
