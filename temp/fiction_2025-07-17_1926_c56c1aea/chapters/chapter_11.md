# Chapter 11

Morty perched on the edge of Rick’s cluttered workbench, knees jittering so hard he could have rattled loose screws from the old plywood. Even breathing carefully, all he could taste was burnt ozone and the metallic tang of panic. He kept his eyes away from the beaker fizzing a dangerous shade of ultraviolet, which popped and hissed like a threat. In Rick’s lab, chaos had reached some kind of singularity—portal gun innards lay splayed beside half-smoked blunts, arc-welded blueprints stuck to a generator with chewed gum, and a suspiciously bulging lunchbox beeped every seven seconds, like it was counting down a joke no one would find funny.

Deadpool swung his legs from the opposite corner of the bench, entirely at home amid the entropy. His hands were everywhere—poking at the blinking core of a half-assembled portal gun, flicking dust onto the plans, eyes gleaming through his mask. “Morty, I am statistics’ worst nightmare. The universe’s existential asterisk. Panic is for B-listers.” He grinned wide enough behind the mask you could almost feel it.

Rick, hunched over the main device with grit in his stubble, barely glanced up. “Just don’t get your crisis all over my soldering iron. Morty, hand me—no, not the Garfield-Toaster, that’s mood lighting. The blue stabilizer.”

“Where’d you even get a Garfield toaster?” Morty muttered, only half-under-his-breath.

Deadpool made a scene rifling through a cracked drawer, arms flailing, props flying. He emerged, triumphant, holding up a battered rubber chicken. “Blue, in the right emotional lighting,” he deadpanned, eyes twinkling.

Morty let out a strangled groan as he scanned the debris, anxiety nipping at the edges of his voice. “Can we not with the bits right now? This isn’t Saturday-morning crisis mode—the meta-collapse is actually melting reality!” The scent of fear, sharp and bitter, came up the back of his throat. His gaze landed on the security camera Rick had wedged behind a pile of scavenged tech—a ghost peering in from their first warehouse disaster. It felt hostile now, as if it was taking its own tally.

For a brief, fragile second, Deadpool’s manic energy eased. Through the mask, his gaze met Morty’s. “Hey. I might look reckless, but if the fourth wall shatters tonight, I’ll get you to the end credits, kid. Scout’s honor.” A tiny pause, then he sniggered, “I was a terrible scout.” The words tried for levity, but Morty caught the weight underneath. Someone in that mask still gave a damn.

Rick’s hands stilled—only a beat, but his knuckles went bone white. “Less talking, more fixing!” he grunted, shoving the blue stabilizer viciously into place. It hissed and sparked, casting strange, shifting shadows on the garage walls—like ghosts flickering through static. For a moment, the overhead lights glitched: an echo of the first time reality split inside Tony the Mobster’s hideout. Goosebumps trembled down Morty’s arms.

“Grab something nonflammable,” Rick barked. “And nobody touches the green lever unless you’re ready to meet platypus Abraham Lincoln again. I mean it!” His voice rang with history—Morty shivered, remembering beak-prints and stovepipe hats.

Deadpool rolled his neck, still smiling, and spun a laser screwdriver between his fingers. “Chill, Rickety Cricket. Existential crises are for Saturdays.” He took aim and zapped a Garfield mug, which detonated into sticky orange fragments. “Oops. That one’s definitely not canon anymore.”

Rick’s patience snapped; he whipped the screwdriver from Deadpool’s grip, glaring enough to burn a hole through concrete. “Touch one more relic and I’ll magnetize you into the next five reboots!”

Morty, back pressed against a battered vending machine buzzing ominously, scanned the madness, searching for logic. “Rick, are you sure this’ll work? Last time you upgraded something, my toaster started negotiating paid vacation and health benefits.”

Rick now had a blender grafted to six portal guns, plus (Morty swore) a prosthetic hip round the back. “Trust in improvisational quantum science, Morty! Just give me the gelatinous flux capacitor—the glowing cube on the third shelf.”

Morty grabbed the cube, trying to ignore how it pulsed sickly-neon, and flinched as it clung to his palm. “Why does it already feel like Deadpool’s handprint is on this thing?”

Deadpool leaned over, voice lilting with oily flirtation and mischief. “Everything I touch gets sticky, kid. Rule number one. Also—no comment about the hand in the corner.” He nodded to a mummified glove from Chapter 3, still perched by the plugs.

Rick crammed the jelly cube home. All three felt it: reality seemed to whine, and a ghostly sitcom laugh track spilled through the garage—like a bigger crack was slicing its way through the fourth wall, toothy with static. Morty’s skin prickled, the world thinner now.

“What if none of this matters?” Morty blurted, voice high and cracking. “What if the meta-collapse just… bends everything out of shape? How do we know it’s even real?” It was more than fear; it was dread he couldn’t name, growing deeper with every reality-wide glitch.

Deadpool’s bravado bent for a second, sincerity flickering through his tone. “Real is who you fight for, kid. What gets you up after the title sequence. Everything else is just special effects and bad writers. Take it from me—I’ve lived through more retcons than cable news.”

Rick’s focus sharpened into dangerous clarity. He toggled a holo-screen; universes zipped by, each more corrupted than the last—rainbow static streaking the glass, colors Morty’s eyes didn’t know how to process. “Villain’s moved three verses away. Anomalies multiplying—faster than a multiversal Spider reboot.”

Deadpool rolled his shoulders, twirling his katana as nerves popped under his clowning. “That’s my cue. Plot thickening, improv knives ready. Anyone else craving chimichangas?”

A crack of thunder rattled the roof, drawing memory from the storm the night their troubles began. Morty could smell ozone—every sense aware the story was about to wrench sideways again.

Rick, hair matted with sweat, made the final adjustment. For an instant, with blue sparks dancing and tension knitting them together, their jury-rigged contraption looked almost—almost—like a real team’s handiwork.

Without warning, Rick slammed the big red switch.

The world howled. A flash of dazzling, bone-deep white exploded outward; static arced, lifting Morty’s hair, squeezing his thoughts so tight he saw old lines of dialogue inside his eyelids. Reality rippled, flexed, then buckled—a larger, hungrier glitch than before, reaching back for them with hungry fingers of unreality.

Deadpool whooped, arms in the air: “Field trip! Tuck your bags and emotional baggage under the seat, kids!” His laughter sounded like static now, weirdly doubled.

Space, time, and every rule they’d ever known twisted, spinning them into the abyss. Their world snapped sideways—all story, no safety net—hurling them straight into the showdown with the joke-thief scattering new chaos through the multiverse.

And this time, Morty clung to hope—just for a second—that messy, mismatched heroes might just be enough.
