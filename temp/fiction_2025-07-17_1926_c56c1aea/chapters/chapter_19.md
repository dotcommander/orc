# Chapter 19

Rick hauled himself upright from a heap of upturned banisters, his lab coat streaked with spectral nacho cheese and interdimensional indignity. The sharp tang of ozone mixed with the unsettling sweetness of cartoon snack dust stung his nostrils. “Morty! Deadpool! Heads up—we’ve gone full M.C. Escher, and I’m pretty sure the painting’s drunk.” He punched spidery, glitching settings on his portal gun; neon arcs jolted through stairwells that twisted, melted, or outright defied gravity. Shadows pooled in the corners, jittering with every ripple of instability in the world.

With a shudder, a stair morphed into a glossy slide beneath Morty’s sneakers. He pinwheeled into Deadpool, arms flailing, slipping through the air like gravity itself was getting stage fright. “Aw geez, Rick! Since when do stairs have vendettas? This better not be because you roasted MC Hammer that one time at Meta-Con.”

Deadpool plucked him upright, barely budging, the squeak of latex and steel echoing weirdly through the shifting space. “Relax! Worst case, we end up in a Dalí landscape and I get to suplex a melting clock. Trust me, pain is temporary, surrealist shame is forever.”

A pulse rolled through the world like bad reverb. Meta-Master’s disembodied voice twisted from everywhere and nowhere at once: “You idiots are just punchlines waiting to drop. Keep bantering—your demise only gets funnier! I own the pen. Reality’s my doodle pad!”

Rick, resolutely unbothered, aimed at a corkscrewing stair. “Your handwriting’s as bad as your patter, you hack! I’ve triangulated memes funnier than your whole personality. Go ahead and monologue, meta-boy—I’m tracking your signal.”

Morty, all nerves, gripped his own portal gun so hard the plastic creaked. “Meta-humor can’t just, like… erase us, can it? We don’t dissolve if the jokes go flat, right?” Fear flickered in his eyes—he glanced sidelong at Deadpool, searching for any extra reassurance in the madness.

Deadpool twirled a katana, eyes bright. “Only if you take yourself seriously, kid. And you’re in the presence of an Olympic-level irreverence champion. Rule one: mock the narrator. Rule two: never trust a joke with feet.”

Suddenly, the floor snapped into a single full-page comic panel—hard outlines, word balloons drifting airily like jellyfish. The world flickered: watercolor, pixels, glossy photorealism, back to pulp. Saturated colors popped, then bled away. Rick staggered, swearing loudly as the floor beneath him warped. “Reality’s coming apart at the seams! If this keeps up, we’ll end up as sticky notes in a freshman’s dorm. Or worse, Banksy’s next installation.”

Deadpool grinned. “Been there, punched that. Time to bust every wall I see—fourth, fifth, whatever’s on the menu.”

They sprinted as the stairs crumbled into blank margins behind them, each step popping with warped, rubber-band sound effects. Every rise twisted physics: risers spitting punchlines, handrails looping Möbius-style, elevator doors popping open with laugh tracks, then slamming shut with a rude raspberry.

Morty’s shoelaces tied and untied themselves, boots momentarily turning into squeaky clown shoes. “Which way is up?! My legs are negotiating with my knees and losing!” He tripped—Deadpool yanked him back just before the banister peeled away into flat panel borders.

“Mental health and impossible stairs follow the same rule,” Deadpool intoned, raising an eyebrow over his mask. “Just keep moving. And never look down—unless the punchline’s printed there.”

Above, Meta-Master cackled and spray-painted “HA! UPPER STORY, GET IT?” across the spinning sky. The walls warped, bleeding colors into a cosmic Etch-a-Sketch, graffiti morphing into little animated stick-figures, doodles blurring into the melting cosmos.

Rick briskly reloaded his portal gun with a glowing cartridge that fizzed and chirped. “Meta-humor’s mangling the rules. Straight-men get it worst—we’ll be rebooted as sock puppets, or, god forbid, a gritty origin miniseries. I snoozed through your last one, Morty.”

Morty groaned. “Last reboot, I had a mullet. It literally haunted my dreams. Never again.”

Deadpool dropped onto a floating railing with a soggy *splat*, hanging by one hand. “This is like my psyche—twisted, self-aware, often missing a step. Still beats group therapy.”

A clown portrait winked back, its eyes swirling with static, echoing Deadpool’s earlier hallucinations. The banister squirmed, and Rick yanked the merc free with a slapstick “pop!” and a shower of confetti.

“Only you break walls hard enough to get paperwork for it,” Rick muttered, recalibrating as he eyed a flickering EXIT sign that blinked “META-NARRATIVE RESOLUTION”—the kind of sign that never means safety but always means trouble.

Morty’s voice cracked, caught between amusement and terror. “The stairs are arguing over who gets custody of the landing! What do we do?”

Deadpool squeezed Morty’s shoulder. “Reality’s flexible. Dance along—and never skip on the tip jar. Worst case scenario: the multiverse gets a hangover.”

Meta-Master’s voice boomed, garbled: “The multiverse spins on its punchlines. You’re trapped until someone nails the ultimate joke!”

Rick cocked an eyebrow at Deadpool—a challenge, half-mad, half-admiring. “If laughs are our ammo, let’s go thermonuclear. Get unserious—fast—or we disappear.”

Deadpool tipped an imaginary hat. “Born for this, Rick. Let’s weaponize some comedy. Real murder’s off-limits—thanks, Squirrel Girl.”

Morty’s heart hammered. “Sure, no pressure. Just gotta be funnier than reality’s collapse. I’m totally not hyperventilating.”

They squared their shoulders—the very picture of absurd heroics. Deadpool crouched low, peering down a stairwell spiraling through three impossible directions. “I have vertigo in places I didn’t know had nerves,” he muttered, sheathing a katana just to flip off a clown portrait—a bookend to his multiversal debut.

Rick, defying the rules of gravity, time, and taste, jerked his thumb at a bucking ceiling—maybe the floor—where a glowing arch beckoned. “Ignore the existential nausea. Just head for the light and pray we don’t get rebooted as ‘Calvin & Dobbs.’”

Morty stumbled after. “Swear to me we’ll never speak of this if we survive. Like that time with horse-Beth—nobody ever brings it up.”

Deadpool grinned behind his mask, already composing a show tune under his breath. “If we live, I’m pitching this as a musical. Smile for the variant covers!”

They bolted for the exit as the world laughed, everything unraveling behind them. For one thrilling, echoing heartbeat, they were perfectly in synch—not merely survivors of chaos, but a team, forged in the fire of white-hot meta-madness that threatened to swallow the multiverse whole.
