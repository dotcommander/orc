# Chapter 13 (Improved Pacing & Flow)

Morty stared in horror as Deadpool dangled the sickly-green capacitor, swinging it like a radioactive Christmas bauble. “Dude! That thing could scramble your DNA or blow us up. Or turn us into, like, yogurt people!”

Deadpool twirled the device, unbothered. “Morty, my DNA’s scrambled more than hotel eggs. Besides, when have I exploded into yogurt without at least a week’s foreshadowing?” He winked skyward, milking some unseen audience.

Rick was hunched over his portal gun, hands a blur of solder and wild calculation. “Chill, Morty. If Wade melts, I’ll just grab another from the multiversal bargain bin. Collect all flavors, make a Deadpool sampler. Infinite universes—someone’s bound to be less annoying.” A schematic flickered over Rick’s face, green grids painting him old and, just for a heartbeat, worn.

Deadpool tossed the capacitor up and down. “All right, Rickipedia: is the plan still portal in, drop some quips, jam this in the villain’s widget, cut to end credits? Feels…familiar.” His mask grinned.

Rick grunted, a sound with barely enough patience to register. “Portal in, plug this into Meta-Monger’s reality engine before the multiverse eats itself. But she’s already a step ahead—probably waiting for us to try the same ‘save reality’ gag one more time.” He shot a sideways look at Morty.

Morty frowned, voice strained but resolute. “Maybe we try talking? Every time we fight them, things get worse. What if we’re just playing along with their plan?”

Deadpool stilled, capacitor mid-spin. “Wow, Morty. You’re suggesting actual emotional maturity? In a meta-comedy action caper?” He patted the air for applause.

Rick slouched, but a rare spark flickered in his gaze. “Kid’s got a point. She’s not just playing by genre rules–Meta-Monger *is* the genre. Changing the story might be the only move left.”

For a moment, the garage was still—three unlikely allies, perched between punchline and collapse.

Deadpool broke the silence, spinning the capacitor once more. “Alright, but when talking fails, I got dibs on cathartic property damage. Non-negotiable.” 

Rick hit the portal gun, green spirals blooming with a half-scientific, half-narrative inevitability. “Let’s get meta. And Wade, try not to redecorate cosmic law with street art this time.”

They moved for the portal, but before stepping through, Rick yanked the capacitor from Deadpool’s grip, clamping it on the workbench. “Hold it. You two almost broke reality last time. Let’s not get demoted to the anthologies nobody reads.” He licked the air, face twisting. “Tastes like expired drama and canceled TV.”

Morty shrank back, arms tight. “Can we just stay on mission? Meta-Monger always seems two steps ahead, like… she knows every punchline in advance.”

Deadpool waved at a phantom camera. “She probably does, Morty. Meta-awareness isn’t just my gig—she’s running narrative calculus. Hi, readers! Go hydrate, we’ll wait.”

Rick didn’t look up. “Wade, break the fourth wall one more time and you’ll be talking through a quantum flux staple. Morty, neuro-resonator. Now. It’s next to Evil Jerry’s head.” 

Morty fished out the blinking helmet, holding it like it might bite. “What does this do?”

Rick jammed it on his brow, LEDs spasming. “Try to sniff out Meta-Monger’s next move, assuming Deadpool hasn’t already jinxed every possible outcome.”

Deadpool bounced onto the bench, feet swinging. “If the wall’s wobbly, improvise. That’s literally my job description!”

A low hum filled the garage. Rick’s tech threw warped TV static and ghost-shadow memories on the walls—a fleeting glimpse of every universe they’d crashed. For an instant, hope and anxiety tangled in the stale neon air. The same jolt they’d felt fighting Smash Mouth mobsters, and at every previous brush with the meta abyss.

Morty paced in nervous loops, eyeing the capacitor and flashing back to the Spaghetti Universe. “So… we do it? Plug it in and hope?”

Rick snorted but kept tweaking circuits. “Technically, there’s a process. In practice, it’s more like Deadpool’s version of Ikea assembly: slap, bang, pray.”

Deadpool gave Morty’s shoulder a buddy-cop squeeze. “Whatever happens, Morty, I’ll pour one out for your carbon-based glory. Could make it gluten-free. Audience sensitive.”

Morty winced, somewhere between terrified and comforted.

Rick jammed the capacitor into its mount, wires sparking and the air filling with the stink of ozone and stale chimichanga. “Here we go. If this ends reality, at least it’ll be an ending.”

Morty stepped back, glancing between the gun, the door, and Deadpool. “Is it… safe?”

Rick’s mouth was tight. “Safe is just another narrative device for people who want to live. Deadpool—don’t improvise. Just pull the trigger.”

Deadpool grinned, took the weapon, and managed a solemn bow. “If this is the end, make sure my tombstone sparkles. And spells everything wrong.”

Rick and Morty went still.

Deadpool fired.

The gun shrieked. A portal yawned open, rippling with colors the script barely described. From its depths: Meta-Monger’s chilling laughter.

Rick straightened, knuckles white. Morty clutched the helmet, eyes wide. Deadpool’s swords flashed and his mask split in a savage grin.

They stepped through, side by side—finally realizing that to win, they’d have to change more than just the ending.
