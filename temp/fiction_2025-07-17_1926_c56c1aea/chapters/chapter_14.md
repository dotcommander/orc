**Chapter 14**

Rick slammed the portal gun shut, sparks geysering across the battle-scarred garage floor, their ozone crackle mixing with old oil, singeing the smell of a thousand failed inventions. “All right, Morty! Deadpool! Stand back, unless you want your molecules scattered across meta-space like avant-garde roadkill.”

Morty yanked himself back, eyes darting from the twitching gun to the flickering, cobwebbed lights overhead. His voice quivered. “Uhh, Rick? Was it supposed to make that—like, that *metal-grinding* noise? Last time it did that we had two heads each for a week. And one of mine kept singing showtunes.”

The gun vibrated, lights flickering like a disco inferno in cardiac arrest, casting broken rainbows on the stained tiles. The air tasted like static and impending headache.

Deadpool twirled his katanas, deadpan. “Please. My digestive system’s scarier after street-meat night.” He eyed the device, scarlet mask squinching. “Sure this isn’t just your coffee maker channeling anxiety?”

Rick shot him a glare hotter than a nova. “Who wouldn’t weaponize kitchenware to save reality? Don’t answer—” He hoisted the sparking invention, feverish-eyed and hunched. He looked like he hadn’t slept for a week; maybe he hadn’t. “Behold: the Meta-Mangler, trademark pending. This baby’ll cap the meta-humor overflow before we all get retconned. Or worse, rebooted by a streaming service.”

Morty edged closer, peering at the thing like it might sprout tentacles and sing “Hello, Dolly!” “So…it fixes the narrative leakage, right? Nothing’s gonna—y’know—erase us? Or turn us into Funko Pops?”

Deadpool patted Morty’s back. “Worst case, we end up in a ‘Love Boat’ reboot. You ever see what happens to guest stars on that show? Hope you like polyester.”

Rick jabbed a screwdriver into the portal gun’s guts, muttering curses in at least three dead languages. “Quit gabbing. Morty—fetch the Stabilizer McGuffin. Looks like a blue Slinky cuddling a potato. Top shelf, left of the Schrodinger’s cat box.”

Morty darted off, sidestepping garage litter—(was that a plumbus from Season 2, wedged under a petrified Couch Potato?)—and fished out the device, yelping as it zapped his fingers blue, leaving a stinging ache and a faint scent of burnt marshmallow.

Deadpool spread his arms wide, blades gleaming in the whiskey-yellow light. “Marvel meets Adult Swim. Plot holes beware: we’re the spackle. The unpaid, overexposed kind.”

Rick snatched the Stabilizer, slamming it home with all the delicacy of an angry rhinoceros. Everything stilled. The air bristled with static, the distant rumble of reality’s foundation ready to crack, the fate of a billion punchlines hanging on Rick’s next twitch.

Ultraviolet light pulsed, turning the dust into little daggers of purple. Instantly, Morty’s eyes went cartoon-wide. “Uhh, Rick? There’s, like, *smoke* coming out now—should the ceiling look like an Instagram filter from the apocalypse?”

Rick didn’t look up, sweat streaking his brow, his voice squeezed tight. “Quantum exhaust, Morty. Chill. We only die if someone sneezes in four dimensions.” He twisted wires frantically, each spark getting closer to igniting something much worse than fire.

Deadpool hopped onto a bench, swinging his legs like a kid waiting at the principal’s office. “Rick, your quantum exhaust better not be sentient. My hamper’s full and my therapist is on strike.”

A blue arc zipped past, singeing Deadpool’s suit with a microsecond of fragrance: burnt Kevlar mixed with eau de gunpowder. He cackled, tilting his head back. “Closest thing to a spa day I’ve had all year.”

Rick yanked the last wire. The portal gun beeped twice, then, impossibly, spat out a translucent, giggling emoji—which zipped around the garage, trailing glitter that embedded itself in the air like silly-string graffiti on existence.

Deadpool lunged at it—*crash*—slamming into a shelf and setting bottles to chime their distress. One rolled under the fridge, hissing quietly.

Morty hit the floor, eyelids fluttering in disbelief. “R-Rick? Are emojis supposed to come out of this? Is that…is that thing taunting us?”

Rick smeared oil across his lab coat, exasperated, jaw set. “Meta-energy’s unpredictable! Memes, puns, animate cringe, you name it. If there’s a dancing banana, I’m out. I have standards—barely.”

As if summoned, a sharp, shrill beep cut through the chaos—the urgency unmistakable, like a fire alarm designed by an anxious stand-up comedian.

Rick scowled at his device with newfound dread. “Don’t like that. Means someone else is hijacking the meta-wavelength. The villain’s cranking up the broadcast. Expect more leakage—fast. Like, end-of-season bad.”

Deadpool lit up, swords spinning. “Leakier is my comfort zone! Quick, before our brains start hashtagging themselves. And for the record: meta-headaches aren’t covered by my dental.”

Rick threw open the garage door, letting in a gust of cold, chemically-tinged night air. “No time to stall. If we don’t jam the Multinarrative now, we’re all toast—and not the good, buttery kind.”

Morty hesitated, wringing his hands until his knuckles threatened to fuse. “Last time you said ‘no stalling’ we got trapped in a musical montage, Rick—my feet still ache from tap-dancing sharks.”

Deadpool addressed the ceiling as if to the cosmic writers’ room. “If anyone’s rebooting us, can I keep the toy royalties this time? Gotta pay for all this emotional damage, you know.”

Rick, half-listening, grabbed the next component. “Deadpool, stick to stabbing. Morty, stick to not fainting. I’ll stick to improvising with barely tested technology.”

The workbench shuddered, thunderous pop. Purple sparks danced across Deadpool’s blades; a half-eaten pizza, inexplicably radioactive, slid toward the edge and teetered ominously.

“Quantum widget—no, the glowy one,” Rick barked through a haze now thicker, darker, the tang of melting plastic invading every breath.

Morty fumbled the part, hands numb, and handed it over. His heart thudded like a trapped mouse. Deadpool, mask rolled to his nose, munched pizza without a care. “Shouldn’t someone call a fire department? Or, like, the TVA? I know a guy, but he’s busy pruning timelines—real union guy.”

Rick seized the widget, sneering. “All Morties panic the same across the Multiverse. And you—” He glared at Deadpool. “If you’re eating radioactive pizza, at least don’t drip on the timeline. Last thing we need is mutant anchovy continuity errors.”

As he snapped the last circuit, the portal gun glowed, purple and angry, humming a low note that vibrated in Morty’s teeth. Rick grinned, wild and proud. “Still got it.” 

A *pixelated distortion* shivered through the garage, overlaying reality with static like a glitched-out YouTube ad.

Reality bent. Comic-panel borders sliced across shelves, spines flickering, everything reduced to pop-art chaos. Caption boxes blinked overhead—[NERVOUSNESS INTENSIFIES] above Morty’s head, the words hanging there, impossible and undeniable.

Deadpool whistled, blades still. “Anyone else feel like a software update’s about to brick us? If Jim Lee’s sketching my abs, I want commission. And a little more definition, please.”

From the ceiling, blocky text flickered: “CHARACTERS SUFFER SEVERE META-OVERLOAD.” For a second, Morty wondered if they’d always been trapped in someone’s idea of a punchline.

Morty gulped. His pulse hammered. “Are we—are we supposed to see our narrative glue melting? Is this…what breaking the fourth wall *feels* like?”

A distorted chuckle echoed—hauntingly familiar, like the villain had always lived between their panels, just waiting for this moment.

The portal gun in Rick’s grip flickered, its shape twisting two-dimensional, leaking impossible color, like a splash of abstract paint attacking the air.

Rick locked eyes with Deadpool, a rare moment of shared focus. “This is it. One wall left.”

Deadpool leaned in toward the audience, voice low and solemn—for once, almost reverent. “Don’t even blink, folks. It’s about to get seriously weird.”
