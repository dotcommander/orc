# Chapter 10

Morty peered over the rim of the sparking console, ducking as a loose cable snapped dangerously close to his ear. A warning stenciled on the panel glared at him: DON’T MIX WITH MULTIVERSE FLUID (Seriously, Rick!). “Uh, Rick? I really don’t think this is a good idea. Last time you opened a rift, like, a million Deadpools showed up and tried to unionize.”

Rick wiped the sweat from his brow with a sleeve, uni-brow twitching. He wielded a screwdriver like he was threatening fate itself. “Morty, the odds of a repeat Deadpool union are statistically insignificant—thirteen percent, tops. Maybe a little higher now that you’ve cursed it by stressing me out.” He belched, slicing the air with the screwdriver. “If we quit now, Comedy Prime gets its way, wipes out irony, meta-humor, fourth walls, everything that makes the multiverse worth watching—or living in.” He jabbed the tool toward a pulsing, shifting anomaly levitating above the lab floor.

Deadpool lounged across Rick’s workbench, feet dangling, flipping a sticky thumb drive between gloved fingers. “Counterargument: twelve Deadpools means legendary Taco Tuesday. Downside? Lawyers might appear. Again.” He flicked the drive into the air; it spun over Morty’s head and almost took out a plasma coil.

Rick snagged it mid-flight with a scowl. “Careful, Red—there’s weird stuff in this lab even you’d find excessive.” He shoved the drive into Deadpool’s palm. “Plug this into the humor core. If anyone’s fourth-wall shenanigans can stabilize it, it’s you.”

Deadpool snapped a salute, nearly knocking over a jar labeled “Rick’s Pickled Existential Dread,” which rattled ominously. “Aye aye, General Inebriation. If we survive, this’ll be funnier than my tax audit highlights reel.” He twirled the thumb drive—then plugged it into the flickering humor core. The lab seemed to tremble in dread.

Morty crowded closer, scanning a jittery monitor: ERROR: META-REALITY UNDEFINED blinked in red. “Rick, the readings are bonkers! You’re sweating cartoon drops!”

“Means it’s working, Morty. Fourth-degree irony is a classic sign of brilliance, right before everything explodes.” Rick’s voice crackled, static arching between his eyebrows. “We’re recalibrating the narrative matrix—just pass me the quantum spanner, Wade!”

Deadpool, ever the performer, jazz-handed and whispered, “Rickty McTickle Fingers, am I about to unlock Bad Pun Powers?” He snatched the glowing spanner—noticing it hummed with worrying radioactivity—and danced it over to Rick.

Above the floor, a shimmering whirlpool spun into being, framed with rippling meme-faces and looping bananas. Morty yelped, grabbing his Szechuan sauce as if it could ward off evil. “Uh—guys? Is the portal supposed to look like that?”

Deadpool squinted. “Either the Internet achieved sentience, or I’m hallucinating again. If Nyan Cat shows up, I walk.”

Rick tore the spanner back. “That’s meta-matter, Morty—the stuff that makes puns possible. The only dangers are logic, linearity, and YouTube comments. Wade, pull that lever—not the red one, the blinking one!”

Deadpool obliged. As his hand closed around the lever, the portal roared—a wave of canned laughter boomed, rippling through the floor. The meme-faces contorted, a Rage Comic panel flashed “Problem?” overhead.

Morty stared, voice thin. “Is this supposed to happen?!”

Rick’s eyes glittered. “Yes, if you want to live! Or, honestly, doesn’t matter—but HOLD ON!”

The lab shook. Consoles sparked. The portal inflated like cosmic bubblegum—then burst, flooding the room with searing white light.

For a moment, everything froze. Only Deadpool’s voice lingered: “Please, not another Spider-Ham crossover. My multiversal animal punch card’s full.”

Shapes and colors jittered at the edges of reality. Rick huddled over the smoldering portal device, solder iron clamped in his teeth. “Spandex McMouth, your odds of turning into quantum spaghetti just hit forty percent. Still better than most of your movie reviews.”

Morty clutched his Szechuan sauce, inching closer. “What about molecule erasure, Rick? That was awful last time!”

Reality flickered. The lab flashed between a noir alley, a pastel sitcom set, and—briefly—a sepia-toned silent film where even their shadowy outlines wore Groucho glasses. Rick worked with single-minded ferocity. “Get used to quantum turbulence, Morty. Now, hush. Do not—DO NOT press that chunky red button unless you’ve got two killer one-liners ready.”

Deadpool leaned in, eager. “You ever think about rebranding as Science Grandpa? Could sell merch.” But his voice softened. “If this goes south, somebody please toss me into the taco timeline. With a working laugh track.”

Rick, glaring, barked, “Touch the discombobulator again and you’ll be cosmic alphabet soup.”

Morty pointed to the center screen—cracks spread from corner to corner, leaking punchlines and flickering glimpses of alternate endings. “The meta-anomaly’s spreading! Are we losing the story?”

Deadpool, for once, quieted. “Plan B: break the fourth wall so hard it reboots itself. You in, Science Grandpa?”

Rick’s hands crafted brilliance from chaos. “Anything to save meta-humor from extinction, Morty. I’d wear pants for that.”

The machine screamed. The portal widened—a hungry, impossible maw. Wind ripped through the lab, tangled with the scent of scorched chimichangas and, even stranger, the distant echo of audience applause.

Deadpool grinned wide, adrenaline and dread sparking together. “I always knew I’d end up as a punchline to the universe.”

Rick slammed the last button. The world fractured, colors spinning, fragments of memes and punchlines swirling together—a vortex of pure, unhinged meta.

“Showtime,” Deadpool breathed, barely audible in the roaring nonsense.

Wind tore them off their feet, reality peeled away, and the lab dissolved into sparkling narrative chaos. Infinite possibility—absurd, dangerous, and a little bit funny—swallowed them whole.
