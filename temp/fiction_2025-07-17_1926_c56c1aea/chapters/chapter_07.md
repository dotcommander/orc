# Chapter 7

Morty trailed Deadpool down the neon-soaked corridor, clutching his portal gun like a lifeline. The walls flickered between comic panels and scrolling lines of corrupted code; the air shimmered with glitch static. Pop-up windows exploded around them—one, shaped like a fortune cookie, chirped, “Sponsored content!” before bursting into confetti.

Deadpool halted, forcing Morty to skid to a stop behind him. “Step right up, folks! Welcome to the Nexus of Narrative Inconsistencies!” He spread his arms with carnival barker flair. “Mind the plot holes—they’ll bite off more than your subplots.”

Morty eyed his surroundings—“Deadpool, dude, are you sure this is safe? Last time Grandpa Rick brought me somewhere like this, we got stuck in a thirty-minute flashback montage.”

“Relax, Morty! Bottle episodes are how you build character.” Deadpool swatted away a floating script page titled *Unused Rick Monologue – Too Depressing*. “And this is where all the deleted scenes and continuity errors end up, so watch your step or you’ll trip over a retcon.”

At the corridor’s far end, static deepened to a low hum. From the haze, the Meta-Monger emerged: a looming brute with a head made of shifting meme cubes and a mouth scrolling every internet punchline ever coined. Its voice glitched across several channels at once. “Think you’re clever, Wade? Joke’s on you. You’re the setup, I’m the punchline.”

Deadpool grinned, swords already in hand. “Big talk from a meme blender. We’re just passing through—got a map to the nearest plot-repair kiosk?”

Reality rippled; walls peeled back to raw sketches and scribbled notes, the universe threatening to edit itself around them.

Morty swallowed, voice dry. “Rick’ll never believe this. Or—worse—maybe it’ll just get deleted.”

Deadpool winked at the ceiling. “Worst case, reboot. Or maybe Disney+ will give me a gritty origin series. I’ll keep the merch rights.”

Meta-Monger’s cube-face pulsed, distortion raking the space. Panels warped. Pop-up notifications zipped past: ‘404 ERROR,’ ‘You Won’t Believe What Happens Next!’ Commentary bubbles swirled above their heads.

“Uh, Deadpool?” Morty squeaked, dodging a flying ‘Subscribe!’ button. “Is it bad the world looks like a glitchy fever dream?”

“Monday brunch, kid.” Deadpool hip-checked a virtual ad into nonexistence. “Lesson one: if the source code flirts, run.” He nudged a floating search bar. “Hey! Directions to ‘Villainous Lair With Bad WiFi’?”

The search bar groaned and zipped away, trailing spinning hourglasses.

Morty inched closer. “Are we even sure Rick’s here? This place is like if Reddit had a nightmare.”

Deadpool glanced sideways, voice softening a beat. “Trust me. Rick-types always end up in reality’s junk drawer. It’s like Pokémon, but everyone evolves into regret.”

Suddenly, the corridor fractured—the walls erupting into comic panels and word bubbles: “WHAM!” “RETCON!” “SNARK!” Hollow laughter echoed, brittle and synthetic.

Deadpool’s smile sharpened. “Looks like someone turned meta-humor into an obstacle course. Ready, sidekick? Reflexes up, existential damage shields on.”

Morty clutched his portal gun. “Ready as I’ll ever be. So, no.”

Each step forward reshaped the corridor—now a staircase, now an MC Escher slide, now a carpet of meme GIFs. “Why is Shrek winking at me?” Morty muttered, sidestepping an animated ogre.

Deadpool jabbed a sword into a pop-up window—it popped in a blast of hashtags and comment pings. “Ignore the ogre. Mission focus! Vic said the Meta Mainframe’s here—poke it right, maybe we get a portal gun that doesn’t break every five minutes.”

Morty eyed the morphing architecture. “Like when Rick hotwired the Continuity Nexus to fix his evil twin problem?”

Deadpool snorted. “Exactly! Smash enough story widgets, something’s bound to glue the universe back together.”

*The air hummed. Walls shimmered.*

A familiar, world-weary burp echoed through the maze.

Ahead, hunched over his sparking portal gun, appeared Rick. His coat was scorched, face deadpan beneath a sprinkle of pixel dust. “Figures. One meta-glitch in the multiverse, you two go full Three Stooges. Reality’s being ‘streamlined’ by an idiot editor program.”

Relief broke across Morty’s face. “Rick!”

Deadpool bounded forward. “Doctor! So—what’s our play? Do I slice through the comic relief, or can we crash the punchline engine?”

Rick wiped his sleeve across his forehead, scowling. “Meta-Monger’s jamming the frequencies. I can override it—but I’ll need time. And someone to carve through joke-shields.” He yanked open his portal gun, fangs flashing. “Morty, just try not to existentially combust, okay?”

Suddenly, pixelated Deadpool doppelgängers swarmed past, all meme-chanting and sound effects. Wade tackled the lead double, who screamed, “CANON VIOLATION—SORRY LOL,” before erupting into error messages and smoke.

Morty shrank against Rick. “Does getting deleted by a sarcastic subtitle hurt?”

Rick jammed a chip into his portal gun. “Only if the writer decides it’s funny. You two, follow me—fast.”

The ground split open: below, a blinding neon staircase lit up, each step stenciled with ‘PLOT PROGRESSION’ in blinking, garish font.

Deadpool sheathed one katana, flourishing the other. “Down we go, gentlemen! Before my thought bubbles turn into Ziggy reruns.”

Rick rolled his eyes. Morty clung to the rail as Deadpool leapt first, sword flashing.

Behind them, Meta-Monger’s distorted laughter glitched and rewound. The corridor’s panels warped and folded, storylines collapsing as reality rapidly rewove itself.

They plunged downward, each step twisting the world further—a breathless freefall through meta-chaos, straight into the teeth of the next layer of multiversal madness.
