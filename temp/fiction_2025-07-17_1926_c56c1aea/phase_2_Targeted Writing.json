{map[ch10_sc1:{10 1 Morty peeked out from behind the sparking console, flinching as another cable popped loose and whipped against the lab wall. “Rick, I really don’t think this is a good idea. What if it opens—like—a black hole again? Or turns Deadpool into more Deadpools?”  

Rick, sweat soaking his uni-brow, jabbed a screwdriver into a glowing core. “Morty, please. The odds of a dimensional rift multiplying Deadpool are only at, like, thirteen percent. Maybe fifteen now that you made me think about it. You want to give up and let Comedy Prime wipe out irony, meta-humor, and—” His burp interrupted the rant. “—my entire reason for existing?”  

Deadpool, sprawled across Rick’s cluttered workbench, kicked his heels while flipping a thumb drive between gloved fingers. “Hey, in fairness, I wouldn’t mind having, like, a dozen me’s. Think of the chimichanga runs! The snappy comebacks!” He tossed the thumb drive up; it narrowly missed a plasma coil. “Whoopsie, almost made everything go kaboom. You sure you want me here, science grandpa?”  

Rick snatched the drive from midair. “Shut up and plug this into the humor core, Wade. Your brand of fourth-wall-breaking idiocy might actually stabilize the charge.”  

Deadpool saluted, exaggerating it until his elbow thunked against a jar of glowing pickles that wriggled ominously. “On it, General Drunky.” He shimmied over and jammed the drive into the humor core. The room trembled.  

Morty yelped, darting to Rick’s side. “Rick! It’s working… or I think it’s working? Are we supposed to see cartoon sweat beads forming on your forehead?”  

“That’s just fourth-degree irony, Morty. Totally under control,” Rick lied, a crackling arc of energy jumping between his eyebrows.  

Deadpool grinned behind his mask. “Gentlemen, get ready to break the fourth wall so hard, we might need a fifth mortgage.” 294 333 Chapter 10 - Scene 1} ch10_sc2:{10 2 Deadpool eyed the portal device cradled in Rick’s trembling hands like a time bomb made of duct tape and bad decisions. “C’mon, Doc Brown, you sure you wired it right? Last time you tried this, I ended up with my head on a spider’s body, and not the fun Halloween kind.” 

Rick, sweat beading above his browline, sneered. “That’s because you touched the ickium converter, dumbass. Now stop flapping your gums and hand me the quantum spanner!” He jerked his head toward the workbench, where a dubious metal object glowed radioactive green. 

Deadpool, grinning beneath the mask, made jazz hands. “You got it, boss. Or should I call you Rickty McTickle Fingers?” He sauntered over, scooping up the tool with exaggerated caution. 

Morty, hovering behind them, glanced nervously at the steadily growing blue whirlpool that hovered inches above the floor. “Uh, guys? That portal’s not supposed to do that, right? There’s, like, faces in it. Are those…are those memes?” 

All three stared as distorted pixelated cats, rage faces, and a dancing banana flickered across the vortex surface. Deadpool whistled. “Okay, either I’m finally hallucinating from all the chimichangas, or we just invented the Internet’s fever dream.”

Rick snatched the spanner, jamming it into the device with frantic energy. “No such thing as reality, Morty! Especially not when we’re being trolled by meta-matter. Hold that lever, Wade—no, the other one!” 

Deadpool leapt in, mashing a blinking button. The portal shrieked, sending out a shockwave that rippled the lab like a bad TV edit. The meme-faces grinned wider. 

Morty yelped, “Is this supposed to happen?!” 

Rick bared his teeth. “Only if you ignore consequences. Which I do. Hang on!”

The room shook, consoles sparking, as the portal ballooned—then snapped, blinding white.

Silence. For a moment, the only thing left was the faint echo of Deadpool: “This better not be another Spider-Ham crossover…” 310 333 Chapter 10 - Scene 2} ch10_sc3:{10 3 Rick grunted, flicking greasy hair from his eyes as he hunched over the portal device. He gave Deadpool a withering look. “Yeah, yeah, Spandex McMouth—there’s only a forty percent chance it explodes in our faces this time. I call that progress.”

Morty hovered nervously behind them, clutching the Szechuan sauce like it was an ancient relic. He eyed the sparking wires. “Uhh, Rick, what if it, like, erases our molecules or something?”

Rick smirked, soldering iron spitting tiny blue sparks. “Then you’ll finally stop whining about algebra.”

Deadpool tilted his masked head, hands theatrically on his hips. “Hey, if we’re getting vaporized, I’d like a little warning. I got socks at home that need matching.” He peered over Rick’s shoulder, eyes catching a glowing button. “Ooo, what’s this do?”

Rick slapped his hand away. “That’s the discombobulator. Touch it again and you’ll be twelve-dimensional spaghetti.”

Morty gulped, shrinking back. “Can you guys, like… not fight for five seconds? The meta-humor anomaly’s getting bigger—look!” He pointed to the monitor, where a psychedelic crack spider-webbed outward, flickering with snippets of alternate realities—a sitcom backdrop, a noir cityscape, even a silent black-and-white frame where they all wore Groucho glasses.

Deadpool sighed, softer than usual. “Okay. Okay, Science Grandpa. Let’s juice this baby up before our punchlines start rewriting gravity.”

Rick’s hands flew over the device, fingers nimble despite their tremor. “Best line you’ve had all day, Poolboy. Morty, brace for—”

The portal device whined, lights surging as the crack yawned wider. A blast of wind whipped around them, carrying laughter, canned applause, and the faint scent of burnt chimichangas. Deadpool grinned behind his mask, feeling adrenaline and dread in equal measure.

Rick slammed a button. The portal roared open, and all three stared into the blinding, kaleidoscopic unknown.

“Showtime,” Deadpool whispered.

The wind sucked them forward—and the world fractured into nonsense light. 309 333 Chapter 10 - Scene 3} ch11_sc1:{11 1 Morty balanced nervously on Rick’s cluttered workbench, avoiding an ominous beaker that pulsed with suspicious purple light. “So, uh, Deadpool, how come you’re not panicking? Forty percent is, like, way worse than the odds I usually survive our adventures.”

Deadpool swung his legs, examining the portal gun’s innards with childlike wonder. “Kid, I’m made of unstable molecules and bad decisions. I don’t do panic—I outsource it to everyone else in the room.” He shot Rick a finger-gun. “Boom! See? Delegation.”

Rick snorted, fingers dancing over soldered wires. “If you cared about odds, you wouldn’t wear red for camouflage.” His eyes darted to the portal device’s flickering core. “Now hand me that quantum stabilizer—no, not the one shaped like Garfield cosplaying as a toaster. The blue one.”

Deadpool rummaged through Rick’s toolbox with deliberately exaggerated incompetence. “Ah, yes, the classic blue doodad. Here ya go!” He brandished a rubber chicken.

“Are you… are you screwing with us right now?” Morty whined, wringing his hands. “If we don’t get this fixed, the meta-collapse will eat everything! I mean, even the theme song could get erased!”

Deadpool paused, all snark evaporating for an instant. In the hum of the garage, he met Morty’s worried gaze. “For what it’s worth, kid, I got screwed-up coping, not a death wish. If it comes down to it, I’ll make sure you get to the end credits.”

Rick’s hands hesitated, but he didn’t look up. “Touching. Now, Deadpool—try not to break reality while touching reality, okay?” He yanked the blue stabilizer free from Deadpool’s grip, slapped it onto the portal gun, and sparks flew.

“Buckle up, kids,” Deadpool crowed. “Whatever’s next, it won’t be boring.”

The device whined, lights cycling toward the red—then blinding white. The air tasted of static. Reality itself began to ripple at the edges. 301 333 Chapter 11 - Scene 1} ch11_sc2:{11 2 Deadpool lounged atop an overturned crate, twirling one of Rick’s laser screwdrivers in his gloved hand. “Panicking? Please. I only do existential terror on Saturdays—and sometimes Wednesdays if I’m feeling spicy.” He winked at Morty, then accidentally pressed the screwdriver’s button. A beam shot out, vaporizing a mug shaped like Garfield’s head.

“Oh, come on!” Rick barked, snatching the tool back. “That was limited edition! You ruin one more thing and I’m building a Deadpool-magnet just to watch you struggle.”

Morty swallowed hard, glancing from Rick’s scowl to Deadpool’s wild grin. “But aren’t you, like…worried? This villain could, I dunno, erase us with a punchline or something.”

Deadpool hopped off the crate, capelet fluttering. “Nyeh! Look, sport,”—he jabbed a finger at Morty’s chest, but it ricocheted off Rick’s hastily extended forcefield, zapping Deadpool’s knuckle—“ow! Meta-humor’s my jam. Fourth wall, fifth wall, whatever. You gotta laugh in the face of annihilation, or else the annihilation laughs at you.”

Rick scoffed, fiddling with a jury-rigged quantum remote. “Yeah? Well, laughing’s not going to recalibrate the Multiversal Humor Regulator before the big bad turns us into yesterday’s running gag. Unless you wanna try slicing through unstable punchline particles.”

Deadpool mimed slicing with his katanas, sending imaginary chuckles slicing through the air. “See? Even my *pretend* skills are devastating.”

Morty slumped, running a hand through his hair. “What if this is all pointless? If stuff keeps getting more ridiculous, how do we even know what’s real?”

There was a pause—brief, uncomfortable.

Deadpool’s mask softened. “Kid, real’s whatever you’re willing to get blown up for. Or who.”

Rick cleared his throat, snapping a holo-screen to life. “Sappy time’s over. Our villain’s latest anomaly just pinged—three universes over.”

Morty’s eyes widened. Deadpool twirled a katana, grinning. “Field trip!” 292 333 Chapter 11 - Scene 2} ch11_sc3:{11 3 Morty shuffled awkwardly near the remains of a vending machine, nervously watching Rick fiddle with what looked like a blender, six portal guns, and maybe someone’s prosthetic leg. Sparks spat from the contraption. “Uh, Rick? You sure you know what you’re doing?” His voice sounded small in the cavernous interdimensional hub, echoing off graffiti-stained walls.

Deadpool leapt off the crate, landing with a wobbly flourish. He tossed the screwdriver aside, missed the workbench entirely, and shrugged. “Don’t worry, Morty. He probably has the scientific, uh, ‘je ne sais malarkey’ required for quantum whatchamacallit stuff. Me? I’m just hoping whatever he’s building explodes in glorious Michael Bay fashion.”

Rick snorted, not bothering to look up. “It’s a recursive meta-lepton destabilizer, Deadpool. If it explodes, we’re all becoming punchlines in a subreddit nobody reads.” He glanced at Morty, who looked on the verge of chewing his own sleeve. “Zip it, Morty. Hand me the gelatinous flux capacitor.”

Morty rummaged through the pile of vaguely menacing gadgets and extracted a quivering, neon cube. “It’s sticky. Why is it sticky?”

“Science, Morty. And probably Deadpool.”

Deadpool grinned under his mask. “Everything I touch gets sticky, pal. Occupational hazard. Also, I had nothing to do with the severed hand in that corner. Let’s move on.”

Rick snatched the cube, jamming it into the growing device. It fizzed ominously. “Connection established,” he muttered. “One more phase and maybe—just maybe—we can track that punchline-thief across realities.”

From somewhere above, distant thunder rumbled—the kind that signaled either an oncoming narrative twist or a hole ripped in space-time. All three tensed in mutual, grudging anticipation, the air buzzing with the kind of tension you can only get when the fate of infinite universes hangs in the balance…and your only backup is a traumatized teenager and a sociopathic mercenary with a kink for chaos.

Rick wiped sweat from his brow. “Here goes nothing.” He slammed the final switch. 318 333 Chapter 11 - Scene 3} ch12_sc1:{12 1 Rick grunted, elbow deep in the guts of his motley device. “Morty, hand me the—no, not the femur, the quantum capacitor. The one with the existential dread leaking out.”

Morty fumbled, poking gingerly at the pile of assembled junk. “Are we sure this is going to, you know, work, Grandpa? Last time you said that, we got chased by interdimensional clowns.”

“Those clowns were an upgrade from this guy,” Rick grumbled, jerking his head toward Deadpool, who was rearranging vending machine debris into a makeshift throne.

Deadpool perched on his new seat with regal flair, twirling a bent can tab. “You guys ever feel like we’re all just action figures glued to a plot by some nerd at a keyboard? Just me? Cool, cool.”

Morty rolled his eyes. “Pretty sure I wouldn’t have picked this outfit if I had that kind of control.”

Overhead, fluorescent lights flickered as a pulse of energy rattled the walls—Rick’s device sputtered, a blue shimmer crawling up the prosthetic leg. “Everybody shut up!” Rick snapped. “This is precision work. I’m quantum-splicing meta-resonance signatures with—oh, screw it, Deadpool, just toss me that Snickers bar.”

Deadpool obliged with an exaggerated windup, pegging the candy directly into Rick’s open palm. “You’re welcome, Doc Brown. Now, while you science, should I keep an eye out for enemies, or just for the next punchline?”

The device hummed, whirring with unexpected smoothness. Rick peeled back the wrapper, taking a monstrous bite. “Keep your fourth-wall monologues to a minimum. If Meta-Maven’s sniffing for us, the less narrative leakage, the better.”

Morty’s voice quaked. “Is it supposed to glow like that?”

A phosphorescent bubble expanded from the device, swirling with fragments of comic panels and TV static. Rick grinned, chocolate in his teeth. “Yeah, kid. This is where things get really weird.” 299 333 Chapter 12 - Scene 1} ch12_sc2:{12 2 Morty finally located the quantum capacitor, eyeing its swirling aura of blue static and vague doom. “Uh, here, Rick. Do I need gloves or, like, a full-on Hazmat suit?”

Rick grunted, flicking a coil into place. “Morty, at this stage you need blind faith and terrible judgment. Hand it over.”

Morty gulped and passed the capacitor. Instantly, the air thickened—smelling faintly of burnt popcorn and overused punchlines. Deadpool, perched on a busted arcade cabinet, watched with an exaggerated yawn. “So, how long till this McGuffin starts glowing and ticking ominously? I need to know when to start panicking attractively.”

Rick smirked without looking up. “You panicking is the default, dipstick. But if you’re offering to be bait for the meta-humor siphon, I accept.”

Deadpool leapt off the cabinet, katana twirling. “Ooooh, is that a formal invitation to do something stupid? You shouldn’t have!”

Morty bit his lip, scanning the smoke-filled workshop. Frayed wires sparked above comic books and a jar labeled ‘Spare Neural Pathos’. “Shouldn’t we talk about, y’know, what if this all goes extra sideways? Like, the plan relies on us being cliché enough to draw out whoever’s hacking reality?”

Rick jammed the capacitor in place. The device rattled, casting flickering shadows. “It’s not just being cliché, Morty, it’s weaponizing it. Deadpool—up for a little self-awareness?”

Deadpool struck a pose, finger-guns blazing. “Buddy, my self-awareness needs a seatbelt. Tell me where to stand and how much to monologue.”

The device lurched to life. Lights strobed, walls warped, and a low-frequency chuckle buzzed in their brains—like the multiverse itself mocking them. Rick wiped sweat from his brow, grinning maniacally. “Here we go. Remember: if the villain drops a catchphrase, nobody laugh.”

Deadpool winked. “No promises, Doc. I laugh in the face of doom. Literally. Morty, you got insurance?”

Morty opened his mouth to respond—when the floor shook violently, and the walls began to bleed word balloons. 316 333 Chapter 12 - Scene 2} ch12_sc3:{12 3 Morty’s hesitation lasted exactly as long as it took for Deadpool to leap over a console and snatch the capacitor from his hand. “Hazmat suit? Pfft. Morty, I’ve eaten chimichangas that were more radioactive than this thing.”

Blue static danced across Deadpool’s gloves; for a heartbeat, he went cross-eyed, watching cartoonish sparks snap at his fingertips. “Ooh. Tingly. Is this supposed to happen, Doc Brown?”

Rick turned, eyeing Deadpool with a scowl so deep it should have had its own gravitational field. “Give it here, dipstick. And don’t drop it, unless you want to see what your intestines look like in five dimensions.” With impressive sleight of hand (and a belch), Rick snatched the device back and began fiddling with its settings.

Morty, who had wisely retreated behind a support pillar, peeked out with bug-eyed suspicion. “I don’t know, guys. The villain’s, like, weaponizing meta-humor. Shouldn’t we—uh, I dunno—use irony-resistant gloves or something?”

Deadpool grinned. “Morty, if I was scared of meta-humor, I’d have never survived my own comic run.” An explosion somewhere above sent dust drifting down. Red warning lights started to pulse in corners none of them had noticed before.

“Man, this place is about to go full Michael Bay,” Deadpool quipped. “Rick, you done playing with your cosmo-Tamagotchi?”

Rick didn’t look up. “Stall the goons. Five more seconds.”

Morty gulped as footsteps thundered down a corridor. Through shattered glass, a squad of surreal, meme-faced henchmen advanced, their faces flickering between Shrek, Doge, and Big Chungus. One pointed at Deadpool and boomed, “Much wow. Very dead.”

Deadpool raised his katanas, voice stagey. “Gentlemen, welcome to the roast—hope you brought punchlines.”

As Rick hunched over the capacitor, Morty grabbed a wrench, adrenaline finally overtaking his anxiety. The meta-humor army surged, and the trio readied themselves, the line between threat and absurdity blurring with every step. 306 333 Chapter 12 - Scene 3} ch13_sc1:{13 1 Morty stared at Deadpool, aghast, as the mercenary dangled the humming, sickly-green capacitor like a grotesque Christmas ornament. “Dude! That thing could, like, scramble your DNA or—”

“Morty, there are only two things in this universe that scramble my DNA: questionable taco trucks and bad writing.” Deadpool winked at the ceiling, as if the stage lights of a cosmic sitcom gleamed down on him. “And I’m still here, baby! Well. Meta-here, anyway.”

Rick snorted, fiddling with his portal gun. “Let him have his fun, Morty. If his molecules unspool, I’ll just fish out a slightly-less-damaged version from another universe. That’s the beauty of infinite mistakes.” He squinted, pulling up a holo-schematic of their nemesis’ lair. Neon grids shimmered, reflecting off his goggles and making him look, for a second, almost earnest.

Deadpool spun the capacitor on his finger. “So, Ricky Ticky Tavvi, what’s the play? Sneak in, boom, quip, save existence, roll credits?”

Rick adjusted the settings on the gun, jaw tense. “We portal in, hit the mainframe, stuff this capacitor into the reality engine before Happy Hour. But the villain—whatever the hell they are—already expects us.”

Morty chewed his lip, nerves jangling. “What if we—what if we try *talking* to them?” He offered, voice trembling but hopeful.

Deadpool froze mid-spin. “Wow, did you just suggest a feelings talk instead of an explosion? Is this Personal Growth? In *my* meta-comedy?”

Rick rolled his eyes, but there was something sharper, kinder in his glance at Morty. “Kid’s not wrong. The villain’s whole schtick is meta-humor. Maybe…breaking the cycle is the only way to win.”

A moment of uneasy silence hung between gun, capacitor, and portal. Deadpool grinned. “Fine. But if talking fails, dibs on first punch.”

Rick primed the portal, green spirals unfurling. “Let’s not keep meta-destiny waiting.”

They stepped through the crackling green doorway, into the unknown. 307 333 Chapter 13 - Scene 1} ch13_sc2:{13 2 Deadpool twirled the capacitor on one finger, grinning beneath his mask. “Relax, Morty. Worst case, I wake up with three extra nipples. That’s hardly a character arc.”

Rick snatched the part out of Deadpool’s hand with a snarl, clamping it carefully onto his workbench. “You idiots almost vaporized us into an ironic footnote. This isn’t a toy, it’s the only thing keeping the meta-fabric from collapsing. Jesus, I can taste the fourth wall fraying.” He flicked his tongue experimentally. “Tastes like burnt popcorn and cancelled sitcoms.”

Morty shuffled back, hugging his arms. “Can we just… focus, please? That—thing—Meta-Monger, or whatever, it’s still out there. And it keeps showing up exactly where it’ll hurt the most.”

“Yeah, almost like someone’s writing them into every terrible situation. Oh wait, that’s literally what’s happening,” Deadpool chimed, waving at an unseen camera. “Hi, readers! Still with us? Don’t you have laundry to fold?”

Rick groaned, digging circuitry from a pile of junk. “I swear, if you break the narrative structure even more, I’ll staple your mouth shut with quantum flux wire.” A pause, then: “Actually, Morty, hand me that neuro-resonator. Left of the Pickle Rick figurine.”

Morty dug through the clutter, retrieving the device—a dented helmet festooned with blinking lights. “What’s this even supposed to do?”

Rick affixed it to his brow, wires dangling. “If I can amplify the narrative signal, we might be able to track Meta-Monger’s next punchline. Assuming Deadpool didn’t fry every probability node with his little juggling act.”

Deadpool perched on the edge of the table, kicking his heels. “Relax, doc. If narrative physics gets weird, we’ll just improvise. Fourth wall punchlines are kinda my thing.”

A low hum filled the garage as Rick’s devices powered up, casting odd specters on the walls. For a moment, all three stared into the uncertain glow, anxiety and bravado holding tight in the flickering light. 312 333 Chapter 13 - Scene 2} ch13_sc3:{13 3 Morty hovered by the workbench, pacing in tight little circles while Rick jammed the reclaimed flux capacitor into the half-disassembled portal gun. The garage was a chaos storm of sparking wires, empty chimichanga wrappers, and the heavy thump of Deadpool’s boots as he bounced in place, impatient as ever.

“So, we just… slap it in and hope for the best?” Deadpool asked, hands on katanas, voice muffled by his mask but still somehow *smirking*.

“I’d say it’s more of a precision science job,” Rick grunted, fiddling with a soldering iron that pulsed with unnatural blue energy. “But sure, Wade, let’s just slap some supercharged multiversal flux in here and cross our… whatever passes for fingers in your healing-factor-horror-show anatomy.”

Morty wrung his hands. “I-I just don’t wanna get turned inside out, okay? Remember the Spaghetti Universe?” He shuddered, focusing on the scorch mark on the wall from their last misfire.

Deadpool sidled up to Morty, pressing a cold, gloved hand against his shoulder. “If you get spaghetti’d, kid, I’ll make sure to pour one out for you. Not like a literal beer, that’d be unsanitary. Maybe a nice marinara?”

“Aaand, done!” Rick barked, flipping a switch on the retrofitted gun. The entire garage hummed with possibility—electric, tense, dangerous. A green spiral flickered inside the portal emitter, erratic and sizzling.

Morty stepped back. “Is it… stable?”

“Stable’s a strong word,” Rick muttered, eyeing the device as if it might explode (it might). “Deadpool, you’re up. If the gun implodes, at least it’ll be entertaining.”

Deadpool seized the gun with gleeful bravado. “If I don’t make it, remember me as the beautiful deviant I was.” He aimed at the wall. A heartbeat’s pause.

Rick and Morty held their breath.

Deadpool squeezed the trigger—

With a crackle and a shriek, a new portal tore open, colors rippling, beckoning them forward. 307 333 Chapter 13 - Scene 3} ch14_sc1:{14 1 Rick slammed the lid down on the portal gun, sending a spray of sparks fizzling to the stained concrete floor. “All right, Morty! Deadpool! Stand back unless you wanna spend the rest of your life as Schrödinger’s disappointment.”

Morty flinched, inching away. “Uh, is— is that thing supposed to make that noise?” The gun vibrated ominously, lights strobed across its surface like a rave in a blender.

Deadpool, unfazed, twirled his katanas idly and cocked his head at the cacophonous gadget. “That’s nothing. My bowels make scarier noises after Taco Tuesday. Seriously, Rick, you sure you didn’t just rewire a toaster?”

Rick glared, veins bulging. “Unlike SOME people, I wouldn’t weaponize bread—” He paused, eyes narrowing at Deadpool. “...Okay, maybe once. But this is different. This—” He hefted the sparking contraption with pride, “is the Meta-Mangler. It’ll stabilize the meta-humor bleed before it turns our brains to literal punchlines.”

Morty shuffled closer, glancing worriedly at the device. “So it’s gonna, what, zap the meta-energy? Won’t that, like, erase us or something?”

Deadpool grinned, voice dropping theatrically. “Dun dun dun! What if we never existed? Is reality just—” He waggled his fingers and whispered, “—bad improv?”

Rick cut him off, shoving a screwdriver between sparking wires. “Less existential babble, more shutting up!” The gun bleeped triumphantly. He wiped his brow. “Now, someone grab the Stabilizer McGuffin from the shelf. Looks like a blue slinky wrapped around a potato.”

Morty scrambled for the shelf as Deadpool struck a melodramatic pose. “We got this, folks! Marvel meets Adult Swim, coming to theaters never. Let’s save the multiverse so we can get back to ignoring our feelings!”

Morty thrust the Stabilizer into Rick’s hand. Rick jammed it into the Meta-Mangler—there was a whistle, a surge of violet light, and the air seemed to twist—

Everything went still, the fate of endless realities teetering on what happened next. 313 333 Chapter 14 - Scene 1} ch14_sc2:{14 2 Morty’s sneakers squeaked as he scrambled away from the disassembled portal gun, hands shielding his head. “Uh, Rick? Should there be *that* much smoke?”

Rick barely glanced up, fingers flying through the tangle of wires. “It’s not smoke, Morty. It’s, uh, semi-sentient quantum exhaust. Totally different flavor of life-threatening.”

Deadpool hopped onto the edge of the workbench, legs swinging. “Can semi-sentient exhaust do my laundry? Asking for a friend who’s me. I leak a lot.”

A burst of blue energy arced dangerously close to Deadpool’s boot. He twitched, grinning beneath his mask. “Or maybe just exfoliate.”

“Would you both shut up?” Rick snapped, tongue poking out in concentration. “I only get one shot at re-tuning the humor frequency, and if I cross these wires—” He connected two leads with a spark. The portal gun shivered—then belched out a translucent, giggling emoji that zipped around the garage.

“Dibs!” Deadpool lunged at the emoji, only to crash into a stack of Rick’s half-empty bottles. He sat up, glass in his lap, grin unbroken.

“Rick, was that supposed to happen?” Morty peered over the bench, eyes wide as saucers.

Rick shrugged, smearing a smear of oil across his lab coat. “Meta-humor is unstable! It could manifest as anything—jokes, memes, psychic punchlines. Or...horrifying puns.”

A rhythmic beeping filled the air. Rick’s eyes narrowed. “That’s *not* a good beep.”

Morty clutched his shirt. “What now?”

Rick stared at the portal gun’s flickering lights. “If my calculations are right, the villain just tweaked the meta broadcast. Reality’s about to get weirder. Expect… complications.”

Deadpool perked up, twin katanas glinting as he bounced to his feet. “Weirder? That’s practically my mating call. Let’s go meta-mashing!”

Rick grabbed the portal gun and motioned to the garage door, steeling himself. “No turning back now. Time to punch through the funny bone of the multiverse.” 305 333 Chapter 14 - Scene 2} ch14_sc3:{14 3 Morty’s sneakers squeaked as he scrambled away from the disassembled portal gun, hands shielding his head. “Uh, Rick? Should there be *that* much smoke?”

Rick barely glanced up, fingers flying over the exposed circuitry. “Relax, Morty, smoke is just science’s way of—”  
A pop! The lab bench lurched. Purple sparks fizzled, raining over Deadpool’s katanas littered alongside a pizza box.  

“—letting you know you’re doing it right,” Rick finished, then coughed. “Hand me the quantum widget. No, not the glowy one. The other glowy one.”

Morty shuffled forward, eyes watering. Deadpool, mask rolled halfway up, snacked on congealed pizza. “Should someone maybe, I dunno, call a fire department?” he asked, mouth full, waving a slice at the chaos.

Rick snatched the part Morty shakily offered. “Morty, you ever notice how every dimension’s version of you still panics the exact same way?” He jammed the widget into the gun. “And you!” He pointed at Deadpool. “If you’re gonna snack, make it useful. Pepperoni’s packed with—”

Before Rick could finish, the portal gun thrummed. Circuits stitched themselves together in a pulsing purple glow. “Ha! Still got it,” Rick smirked, just as a sudden, pixelated distortion rippled through the room.

The walls flickered—actual comic panel edges slicing the lab in sharp relief. Word balloons drooped from the ceiling. Deadpool gave a low whistle. “Whoa. Feels like we tripped into a software update. You guys seeing this?”

On the ceiling, bold text sputtered: “CHARACTERS EXPERIENCE SEVERE META-OVERLOAD.”

Morty gulped. “Uh, should our reality be—*reading itself*?”

A distant, glitchy chuckle echoed, weirdly familiar—laced with static.

Rick paled. “That’s… not good,” he muttered. The portal gun in his hand warped, turning partially two-dimensional. They collectively edged backward, the fourth wall melting, unreality leaking through.  

Deadpool glanced at the reader. “Don’t touch that dial, folks.” 298 333 Chapter 14 - Scene 3} ch15_sc1:{15 1 Morty ducked behind a busted arcade cabinet as neon sparks spat from the gutted portal gun, pooling ozone in the ruined air. Rick hunched above the smoldering device, screwdriver between his teeth, muttering curses that alternated between quantum physics and complaints about Deadpool’s taste in chimichangas. The floor trembled—a subtle whump, then another, the rhythm oddly familiar.

Deadpool waltzed into view twirling a pair of katanas like batons, his mask singed at one edge. “Good news, gents! I got us a distraction. Bad news: I *am* the distraction.”

A chorus of staccato applause—really more of a slow, metallic clapping—echoed through the corridor. From the haze emerged the villain: The Stand-Up, their patchwork tuxedo and holographic bowtie flickering with static. Microphones orbited his head like malevolent moons.

“Oh great,” Rick groaned, jabbing a finger at Deadpool, “This is what happens when the multiverse’s least stable molecules try to play hero. We get *him.*”

The Stand-Up bowed with a flourish. “I thank you! And now—as they say in sitcoms—‘let’s get this show on the road.’” A microphone zipped from his orbit and pressed itself against Rick’s chest, emitting a harsh feedback squeal.

Morty, wide-eyed, risked a peek. “Uh, guys? I think he’s about to—”

A flood of one-liners burst from the mic, weaponized puns so bad reality itself winced. The floor buckled into punchlines: literal banana peels, anvils, a piano teetering overhead. Deadpool leapt forward, slicing an airborne rubber chicken in half.

“Finally!” Deadpool shouted, grinning. “A villain who respects the art of the callback!”

The Stand-Up cackled, firing off more reality-warping jokes. Rick yanked Morty back, shielding him from slapstick shrapnel. “If we don’t counter his shtick with our own, we’ll get erased—ironically!”

Deadpool cracked his knuckles. “Looks like it’s improv night, boys.”

The trio squared up as the room twisted—a stage set for chaos, and the show had just begun. 310 333 Chapter 15 - Scene 1} ch15_sc2:{15 2 Morty’s knuckles whitened around a scorched joystick as Deadpool, half-sitting atop the cracked pinball machine, surveyed the carnage like a bored king. Shimmering, unstable currents of meta-energy crackled from the fractured portal gun’s exposed core, arcing dangerously close to Rick’s gray-streaked hair.

“Hey, science Santa, maybe don’t cook us with existential lightning?” Deadpool twirled a broken paddle. “I’m already crispy from the outside in.”

Rick spat out the screwdriver. “You want to fix this, dipshit, be my guest,” he grumbled, soldering iron alight. “Or go quip somewhere else before the quantum punchline lands on your head.”

Morty, wide-eyed, peeked from his cover. “Is—is that normal? It’s glowing brighter.”

“Nothing’s normal, Morty,” Deadpool said, eyes flickering to the spreading web of energy above them, their reality rippling like cheap green-screen effects. “But you? You’re doing a great job holding up that perfectly defenseless cabinet.”

Rick’s hands worked furiously, sweat beading on his brow. “We’re about to get smacked with a recursive meta-collapse. If the joke eats itself, we all blink out. Permanently.”

Deadpool leaned forward, voice dropping. “Wait, like actual dead dead? Not comic book dead?”

Rick didn’t look up. “Dead dead. Non-existent. Even the part of you that thinks you’re in on the gag.”

For a beat, the humor thinned, leaving only the humming portal core and the three of them—halos of fear and stubbornness, shadows dancing in garish arcade light.

“Okay, okay, you need help?” Morty gulped, inching forward.

Rick nodded once, tersely.

Deadpool hopped down, tossing the pinball at the rippling energy, which ate it with a pop. “Time to get hands-on, boys. Just don’t let the multiverse see us sweat.”

A new surge from the device scattered coins and glass across the floor. Together, their silhouettes gathered around the ailing portal gun—improvised heroes in the neon ruin—preparing, wordlessly, to take on oblivion. 305 333 Chapter 15 - Scene 2} ch15_sc3:{15 3 Shimmering, unstable currents of meta-energy traced outlines in the scuffed arcade carpet, flickering through half-destroyed consoles. Deadpool polished a nonexistent speck on his sword hilt, voice too casual. “Well! That was… educational. Rick, buddy, next time you point your portal gun at a self-referential anomaly, could you *not* aim it at my crotch?”

Rick, arms buried to the elbows inside the sparking guts of a Street Fighter cabinet, grumbled without looking up. “I said hold still. Quantum feedback doesn’t discriminate between plot device and plot *armor*.” He yanked out a glowing circuit board. The severed data lines spat out code in actual Comic Sans, writhing into jokes about the author. “Great. We’re down to one continuity and a fistful of punchlines.”

Morty, still gripping the ruined joystick, squeaked, “Are… are the reality stitches supposed to *hum* like that? Also, my fingers are numb.” Above them, the rip in the fourth wall pulsed and distorted, revealing flashes of audience faces—some bored, some laughing, all impossibly, unreachably *real*.

Deadpool hopped down. “Look alive, fellas. Or at least don’t die in a boring way. This villain’s whole schtick is draining universes dry, one wink at the camera at a time.” He eyed the rip as it spasmed, spit out a half-finished sitcom laugh track, and then sucked it back up.

Rick tossed Morty the circuit board. “Hold this. Don’t let it insult your intelligence. Deadpool, get ready—we’re going on offense. We’re down to meta-brass tacks here. If we can disrupt the punchline stream, maybe we buy the multiverse a few more panels. Or at least get a decent exit cue.”

Deadpool raised his swords. “Nothing makes me happier than existential improv—except maybe tacos, or mocking narrative structure itself. Let’s give ’em a show.” He winked, not sure if at the others or the audience.

Somewhere, the fourth wall trembled—waiting. 306 333 Chapter 15 - Scene 3} ch16_sc1:{16 1 Deadpool’s mask crinkled in mock concern as he paced around the center of the shattered arcade. “So, if I press this button,” he said, one gloved hand hovering over a console’s battered control panel, “will it save the universe, or turn us all into Funko Pops?” He looked over his shoulder at Morty, who was furiously trying to reroute meta-energy with duct tape and a half-melted joystick. 

“Don’t—d-don’t even joke about that!” Morty stammered, sweat beading along his brow. “I do *not* want to live the rest of my existence with giant soulless eyes, dude!”

Rick, meanwhile, had sprawled out across a prize counter, legs flopped over a stack of dusty Tetris cartridges. He rummaged for any salvageable tech parts, his voice a droll monotone: “Just hit the red button, Wade. Worst-case scenario, we get rebooted for a grittier streaming platform.”

Deadpool grinned behind his mask, flipping the sword in his hand like a drumstick. “That’s the spirit! Who’s ready for a reckoning with the laws of comedy and reality simultaneously?” He stabbed the air twice for emphasis, then—against everyone’s better judgment—slammed his palm onto the oversized button.

A pulse of meta-energy burst from the console, tearing across the room in neon fractals. The walls melted into TV static, then snapped back, flickering between settings: a sitcom living room, a noir alley, a pixelated dungeon. Morty yelped as a couch materialized under him, launching him into the air.

“Whoa—okay! That’s—never doing that again!” Morty scrambled for footing as gravity returned.

Rick adjusted his portal gun. “Reality’s shredded. Nice going, Deadpool. But hey, at least the laugh track’s working again.”

Indeed, canned audience laughter echoed, inexplicably, from the ceiling.

Deadpool dusted off his hands theatrically. “If we die, I’m asking for a refund. But if we live… dibs on the sitcom spinoff.”

A jagged hole of pure meta-energy pulsed open in the arcade floor. They exchanged glances—time to jump or be swept away. 322 333 Chapter 16 - Scene 1} ch16_sc2:{16 2 Morty slapped Deadpool’s hand away from the suspiciously blinking button. “Dude! Didn’t Rick literally say not to touch anything with glowing glyphs on it?”

Deadpool scoffed, eyeing Morty with feigned injury. “Are you implying I can’t resist the siren call of clearly dangerous, irresistible buttons? That’s on-brand for me, kid.”

Rick, hunched over a surging tangle of neon wires, didn’t look up. “If our realities flatline because you two played Whack-a-Multiverse, I’m not replacing *either* of you with alternate versions. Too exhausting.”

Deadpool strolled over to a cracked pinball machine, poking the glass. “Alternate versions? Is there, like, a Deadpool somewhere who reads instruction manuals instead of improvising with high explosives?”

“Statistically, yes,” Rick muttered, rummaging through a pile of blinking circuit boards. “But he’s a huge disappointment at parties.”

Suddenly, an erratic whine rattled the walls. The arcade’s fluorescent tubes flickered—a spiraling hole tore open above the skee-ball lanes, spraying pixels and fragments of comic strip speech bubbles.

Morty’s voice trembled. “Uh… What *is* that?”

Rick swore quietly. “A narrative rift. Our villain’s getting creative with reality-editing. Right on schedule.”

As a word balloon floated by—lettering morphing between “KABOOM!” and “WHOOPS!”—Deadpool whipped out his katanas, slicing it in half midair. “Can’t they pick a punchline and stick to it?”

Rick snorted, pulling Morty behind a toppled arcade cabinet. “If we’re going to stabilize the plot, I’ll need thirty seconds to hijack the mainframe. Try not to escalate things.”

Deadpool grinned wolfishly, squaring up to the mawling rift in the ceiling as stray cartoon limbs wriggled out. “Copy that. I’ll be the comedic relief *and* the front line.”

He planted himself between the chaos and his teammates, twin blades gleaming, as reality itself cackled ominously—and the odds of making it out in one sane piece shrank by the second. 299 333 Chapter 16 - Scene 2} ch16_sc3:{16 3 Deadpool turned to Morty, feigning hurt. “Glowing glyphs are my whole aesthetic, Mort. It’s like telling Willy Wonka not to lick things.”

Morty crossed his arms, suspicion all over his face. “Look, I’ve seen enough of Rick’s labs to know you don’t mess with the glowy stuff. I mean, last week he melted half the garage with—wait, does that sigil look like it’s getting brighter?”

They both stared as the glyphs pulsed, radiating sickly chartreuse light. Behind them, Rick rummaged through a backpack brimming with dubious tech. “Hey geniuses!” he barked, not looking up. “If you’re done caressing the Doomswitch, can someone hand me the quantum disinhibitor?”

Deadpool squinted at the device Rick held—a tangled mess of wires and what looked suspiciously like an egg beater. “Is that safe to touch, or is this another Monty Python reference waiting to happen?”

Rick snorted, grabbing a gadget. “It’s only dangerous if you’re sober, which, thank god, I’m not.”

Suddenly, the glowing glyphs spiked, throwing frantic shadows on the walls. Morty yelped as the floor shivered beneath them—something deep and wrong building in the air.

“Ah, fudge!” Deadpool crowed, instinctively raising his katanas. “That’s never a good sign. Last time I saw lights that color, I woke up married to a Skrull.”

A fissure of shimmering energy split the air, and a voice boomed from nowhere and everywhere: “You dare tamper with the Meta-Nexus? Prepare for disconnection!” A sinister laugh echoed, pixels fluttering around the trio like dying butterflies.

Rick fumbled with the quantum disinhibitor, eyes wild. “Of course it’s the meta-police. Everybody shut up and do exactly as I say—and if you can’t, at least die funny!”

The room trembled. Deadpool grinned maniacally at Morty. “On the bright side, you can’t say your life’s not interesting,” he quipped, as reality buckled and the world twisted in on itself. 307 333 Chapter 16 - Scene 3} ch17_sc1:{17 1 Rick shrugs off the last of the portal static clinging to his lab coat, grumbling, “Alright, knuckleheads, we made it past the first knot of paradox—nobody here got existential whiplash, right? Wade, check your spleen.”

Deadpool looks down, pats his torso, then grins behind the mask. “Still squishy! But if you see me sprout another arm, let’s all pretend it’s a power-up.” He twirls his katanas for effect, the blades humming with unstable energy left over from their jaunt through meta-space.

Morty edges away from Deadpool’s swords, eyes fixed on the battered, comic-book style map Rick produced earlier. “So, uh, what’s next? The villain’s lair? Please tell me it’s not in a haunted amusement park or, like, inside a giant pie.”

Rick snaps his fingers. The holomap flickers, revealing shifting panels stacked like comic book frames. “No amusement parks, just an irony fortress at the center of the Multiversal Script Engine.” He leans in, voice dropping. “Villain’s going big time—he’s hijacking the narrative framework itself. Next stop, tropes made flesh. And not the cool ones.”

Deadpool sheathes his swords, steps closer to Morty, and says, “Buddy system! Safety in snark. You ever face sentient plot contrivances?”

Morty groans. “Do I look like I even know what that means?”

“Guys,” Deadpool stage-whispers, “the wall over there is… blinking at me.”

They turn. The literal fourth wall—a shimmering membrane—ripples, eyes forming out of negative space, winking conspiratorially.

Rick cackles. “Yup, we’re close. When the fourth wall starts eyeing *us*, you know you’re headed for the boss level.” He slaps a gadget into Morty’s hand. “Interface it. Realities might unravel—so keep it together, will ya?”

Morty gulps, but his hand’s steady as he touches the device to the glowing wall, bracing himself for whatever’s next.

And the wall dissolves into fractal panels, revealing a corridor lined with laughing echoes of their own voices, beckoning them onward… 313 333 Chapter 17 - Scene 1} ch17_sc2:{17 2 Deadpool shakes his head, trying to clear the inside-out feeling that lingers from traveling through the metaphysical guts of the multiverse. “Speak for yourself, Doc Brown. My spleen’s in French and my brain is still buffering. And yet—” He slaps the side of his head theatrically. “Nothing! Why do I pay for premium?”

Morty, wobbling on his feet, glares at Deadpool like he might be contagious. “We almost, like, vaporized, man. What if there’s time ghosts stuck to us now?”

Rick fishes a battered flask out of his coat. “Relax, Morty, worst you’ll get is a mild case of narrative vertigo. Or a new phobia. Either way, something for your therapist.” He unscrews the flask and takes a swig, then offers it to Deadpool, who accepts it with a grateful flourish.

“Y’know, I expected interdimensional travel to be more… interdimensional. You know? Where’s all the lightning and gravitas? I feel like we skipped six months of gritty character development.”

Morty checks his own hands as if they might turn into spaghetti. “Rick, are we really safe here? That villain—Meta-Lord or whatever—he can still find us, right?”

From the gloom, Rick flicks a switch and the chamber floods with blinking lights, screens unfurling like digital scrolls around them. “Safe is relative, Morty. Here in my crossroads cache, reality’s got enough guardrails; Meta-Lord won’t sniff us for at least—” he glances at a watch physically labeled ‘Plot Device’—“ten minutes, unless he gets a writer’s note.”

Deadpool holds up the flask and grins. “So that’s how long we have to plan the villain’s existential comeuppance, or at least make some truly questionable decisions before the meta-maw unhinges and eats us?”

Rick smirks, his eyes reflecting screens full of impossibly branching realities. “Let’s not waste time, then.”

A flicker of something—hope, fear, or maybe just static—passes through Morty. The trio circles the console, facing the next impossible step together. 315 333 Chapter 17 - Scene 2} ch17_sc3:{17 3 Deadpool rolls his shoulders, glancing around at their bizarre new surroundings: a swirling Escher-esque corridor where staircases overlap and impossible doorways hover in midair. Every few seconds, the walls flicker with snatches of comic book panels and cartoon backgrounds—someone’s greatest hits collage, with the punchlines all jumbled.  

“New Rule,” Rick groans, patting his coat for a fresh flask (and finding a banana, two grenades, and, with a shrug, the flask). “We don’t do that kind of travel again unless reality itself is on fire.”  

Morty peers at a floating window showing a version of himself with enormous biceps fighting a taco. “Uh, is it supposed to be doing that?”  

“Morty, don’t make eye contact with the alternate buff version. It’s bad for your self-esteem,” Deadpool quips, reaching out to prod one of the warped comic panels. Instead of resistance, his hand sinks right through, accompanied by a satisfying *boing-oing* sound effect and a cloud of animated birds.  

“Okay, this is just getting more meta by the minute,” Deadpool says, pulling back his arm—now awkwardly shaded in cel animation. “Does anyone else smell imaginary ink?”  

Rick squints down a corridor, then suddenly drops his flask. “That’s not just good meta: look.”  

At the far end, a shadowy figure emerges through a rippling speech bubble—every word trailing from its mouth becomes a semi-solid piece of reality, like floating text boxes weaponized.  

Morty gulps. “Is that… THE VILLAIN?”  

“As advertised.” Rick’s voice is grim. “Whoever that is, they’ve already bent the narrative physics. We’re walking into their punchline now.”  

Deadpool draws his katanas, spinning them with a flourish. “Fine by me. I never liked punchlines I didn’t write.”  

He gestures for Morty and Rick to fall in; together, they step toward the heart of the impossible corridor, ready—or not—for the next joke to turn lethal. 302 333 Chapter 17 - Scene 3} ch18_sc1:{18 1 Deadpool pauses, twin katanas idly resting on his shoulders as he surveys the ever-shifting architecture with a theatrical sigh. “All right, MC Escher wants his nightmares back.”

Morty shuffles close behind, eyes saucer-wide. “W-where are we now? Guys, this place feels like the inside of a math problem—one I definitely can’t solve!”

Rick burps, staggering forward as if the floor is moving—which it very well might be. “We’re in the Meta-Maze, Morty. Multiversal defense mechanism. Only place more convoluted than a comic book crossover.”

A stairway folds in on itself just as Deadpool jumps, flipping midair and landing sideways on a wall that is suddenly the floor. He grins, waving at Morty and Rick, who are now standing at a right angle to him. “I always wanted to moonwalk up a paradox. C’mon, it’s fun!” He moonwalks, finger guns blazing.

Morty follows tentatively, gravity bending with each step. “Gramps, do you see that?” He points to a looping corridor, where frames flicker like the pages of a comic book being thumbed too fast. Inside, distorted images of themselves argue in infinite panels.

Rick snorts, fiddling with a rewired portal gun. “That’s just the maze mocking our existence, Morty. Or possibly referencing the last time I blacked out inside a Grant Morrison fever dream.”

Suddenly, a booming laugh echoes. The walls ripple, the staircases rearrange, and a voice—simultaneously familiar and impossible—fills the air. “Welcome, travelers! Ready to get lost in your own punchlines? Or would you rather face the heart of the joke?”

Deadpool spins, swords raised. “Ha! Been lost for years, pal! Now where’s the punch(but not the)line?”

Rick glances at Deadpool, then Morty. “Stay close. If this maze is truly meta, our only way out is through.”

All three steel themselves, and together, they step forward as the corridor shivers, the laughter growing louder. 305 333 Chapter 18 - Scene 1} ch18_sc2:{18 2 Morty shuffles closer to Deadpool, casting anxious glances at the folding staircases. “Seriously, guys, are we sure this is the right layer of reality? Because my knees feel inside-out, and I’m pretty sure doors don’t usually have teeth.”

Rick’s portal gun beeps, projecting a hologram of branching timelines above his palm. “According to my readings,” he slurs, poking at the display, “we’re exactly one bad punchline away from nonexistence. Congratulations, idiots, you’re now statistically more unstable than my liver function.”

Deadpool twirls a katana with mock elegance. “Hello, metaphysical horror! I’d like to return your ambiance—preferably with a side of salsa.” He taps a grinning, chattering doorknob with his swordtip. It giggles, then bites. “Okay, NOPE, no handsies!”

A sudden tremor ripples through the walls. The architecture bubbles, stairs flow like syrup, and words appear—actual, floating words: LAUGH TRACK MALFUNCTION.

Rick groans. “Yup, the villain’s cranking the meta to eleven. If we don’t recalibrate the punchline stabilizer, we’ll be reduced to a running gag.”

Deadpool strikes a pose, katanas crossed. “Bring on the gags! I do my best work under comedic duress. Or any duress, really.”

Morty’s voice cracks: “Any chance we can—I dunno—skip to the part where we fix this, before the ceiling rewrites us into a knock-knock joke?”

Rick flicks a dial on the portal gun. Electric blue sparks bloom, distorting reality tighter around them. “Follow me, or don’t. Either way, I’m not letting some family-size packet of meta-humor turn us into concept art.”

The floor yawns beneath their feet, transforming into a conveyor belt lined with punchlines. With a collective yelp, the trio is whisked deeper, the sound of canned laughter echoing after them. 

Deadpool’s eyes shine behind the mask. “Hey, at least we’re getting a laugh out of it,” he quips, as the world slides into the next gag. 303 333 Chapter 18 - Scene 2} ch18_sc3:{18 3 Deadpool swings his katana in a lazy arc, watching as the impossible geometry of the staircases folds over itself like origami. His maskless eyes gleam through the red fabric. “Morty, buddy, if your knees feel inside-out, that means you’re *in* the right reality. Mine are basically Jell-O and unresolved trauma twenty-four-seven.”

Rick, footing precarious on a staircase that suddenly unravels into a Möbius strip, barks, “Less philosophizing, more moving! Meta-Humor’s signal is literally rewriting the architecture of this place—if we don’t get to the source, we’ll be Escher doodles before you can say ‘self-referential nightmare!’” He snaps open his portal gun, but it fizzles, emitting only a sad honk.

Morty whimpers as a banister twists into a question mark. “What if we get stuck here forever? I don’t wanna—like—be a punchline for some cosmic joke!” He grabs Deadpool’s sleeve as if the mercenary’s chaos might anchor him.

Deadpool gives Morty a sideways squeeze, surprisingly gentle. “Kid, the difference between a joke and a tragedy? Timing. And we’re *not* missing our cue. Rick, ideas?”

Rick’s eyes dart. “We need to trigger a narrative leap—something so out-of-genre it forces the story to stabilize. But it’ll have to be big.” He pulls out a flask, swigs, then belches a cloud of neon punctuation.

“How about a heartfelt musical number?” Deadpool suggests, jazz hands ready. “Nothing upends tone like jazz hands.”

Morty groans, but Rick grins. “Perfect. If irony’s the ammo, let’s overload the gun.”

Suddenly, an over-sized, spotlighted piano descends from above. Deadpool cracks his knuckles and smiles. “Break a leg, boys—but not on these stairs. OSHA’s gonna *hate* this place.”

Rick hops onto the bench, Deadpool on vocals, Morty reluctantly harmonizing. Their voices and chords echo, warbling against reality, as the stairs writhe in uncertainty—waiting for the punchline. 296 333 Chapter 18 - Scene 3} ch19_sc1:{19 1 Rick hauls himself up from a tangle of upside-down banisters, his lab coat smeared with spectral nacho cheese. “Morty, Deadpool—heads up! This M.C. Escher fever dream’s going recursive!” He flicks a glowing switch on his portal gun, sending static ripples through the impossible stairwells. Morty glances down as a stair beneath him melts into a slide, sending him hurtling past Deadpool.

“Whoa—oh jeez, oh jeez—” Morty tumbles, slamming into Deadpool, who barely budges. Instead, Deadpool throws out an arm to steady him.

“Relax, Morty. Worst case, we land in a Salvador Dalí clock factory and I finally get to prove I can punt a melting clock through a goalpost. Trust the process.”

A beat—then the villainous Meta-Master’s voice cackles from everywhere and nowhere. “You fools remain pawns. Your cozy banter only accelerates the punchline. Reality is a sketch, and I own the pen.”

Rick fires off a plasma shot up a twisting stair. “Yeah? Your pen writes like a sixth grader on TikTok. Keep monologuing—I’m triangulating your meta signature.”

Morty’s hands shake as he struggles to his feet. “Can meta-humor even hurt us? Or like… un-exist us?”

Deadpool spins a katana, grinning. “Meta-humor only hurts if you take yourself seriously. Lucky for us, you’re surrounded by experts in not giving a—”

The world hiccups. Suddenly, the floor becomes a panel of comic art, speech bubbles drifting through the air. Everything flickers between styles—watercolor, pixels, photorealistic. Rick yells, “Destabilization’s accelerating! If we don’t shut this down, we’ll end up as footnotes in a postmodern thesis!”

Deadpool leaps forward, sword raised. “First time for everything! Let’s break outta the margins, boys.”

As the trio barrels ahead, the staircases begin to collapse into whiteness, erasing behind their every step. 286 333 Chapter 19 - Scene 1} ch19_sc2:{19 2 Morty lurches upright, clutching the portal gun like a child drags a tattered teddy bear at bedtime. “Rick, how do we tell which stairs go up and which ones go sideways?!” His shoelaces have been tied together by an impossible logic loop—they knot and unknot themselves as he walks.

Deadpool, popping into existence halfway up a floating bannister, dangles by one hand and waves the other. “Guys! These stairs remind me of my mental health. Complicated, weirdly twisted, and you always end up back where you started, except with more bruises!”

Somewhere above, the walls flicker, the villain’s graffiti-style laughter echoing: “HA! UPPER STORY, GET IT?” Reality whorls like someone’s jiggling a cosmic Etch-a-Sketch.

Rick reloads his portal gun with a belch. “Meta-humor’s destabilizing the physics. If we keep playing along, we’ll get rebooted into sock puppets. Or worse, a gritty reboot!”

Morty’s eyes widen. “Rick, my legs are going sideways. My knees aren’t supposed to bend like this!”

Deadpool lands with a gelatinous thunk. “Relax, buddy, just break the fourth wall—oh wait, we already did that. Maybe try the fifth? Or the floor; I hear it’s actually cake.”

He grabs Morty’s hand, pulling him onto a step that looks safe, though it fizzles with punchlines. For a moment, the three stand together, united by confusion and stubborn hope.

The villain’s distorted voice booms overhead: “Don’t you three nerds get it? Punchlines power the multiverse now. The only way out is the biggest joke.”

Rick narrows his eyes, almost impressed. “Alright, team: time to get seriously unserious. If laughter’s the weapon, we out-joke the joke.”

Deadpool tips an imaginary hat. “Finally, a plan I can live with. Or die with. Or live, then die, then live again with. Let’s make ‘em laugh till the universe wheezes.”

Morty gulps. “No pressure.” The trio square their shoulders, stepping forward—into the epicenter of absurdity. 311 333 Chapter 19 - Scene 2} ch19_sc3:{19 3 Deadpool crouches at the landing, twin katanas poised, peering down a stairwell that corkscrews in three impossible directions at once. The gallery’s architecture has gone full Escher, paintings of clowns winking knowingly from the warped walls. “I’m getting vertigo in places I didn’t know I had places,” he mutters, sheathing one blade to give a clown the finger.

Rick, unbothered by physics or basic decency, jerks a thumb toward the ceiling—or maybe the floor—where an exit flickers in and out of existence. “Standard meta-liminal geometry,” he grumbles, yanking a flask from his lab coat and swigging. “Just ignore causality and head for the light. Worst case, we end up in a Calvin and Hobbes reboot.”

Morty gulps, eyes flicking from Rick to Deadpool. “You guys act like this is normal. How is this normal? The stairs are arguing with each other!” He points as two steps physically part ways in a messy divorce, one reshaping into a spiral, the other sulking away as a ramp.

Deadpool gives Morty’s shoulder a squeeze. “Look, kid, reality’s more flexible than an Olympic gymnast. Step lively and just pretend the universe is rooting for you.” He winks—then promptly sinks halfway into the wall with a cartoonish “boing.”

Rick sighs, grabbing Deadpool by the arm and yanking him free with a wet pop. “Classic. You break the fourth wall so hard, even the infrastructure’s insecure,” he snarks, recalibrating his portal gun mid-leap onto a looping staircase. “Come on, trauma buddies—showtime’s that way.” He points, and a glowing neon exit sign flickers above a distant archway, spelling “META-NARRATIVE RESOLUTION.”

Morty chases after, tripping over his own feet and barely catching himself. “If we survive this, can we, like, never speak of it again?”

Deadpool grins. “No promises, kid. I live for the sequel.”  

They charge toward the exit, the stairs writhing beneath their feet, the laughter of unseen audiences echoing behind. 315 333 Chapter 19 - Scene 3} ch1_sc1:{1 1 Deadpool hurled himself through the glass window, somersaulting into chaos. It was Tuesday – or as he preferred to call it, “Carnage and Chimichangas Day.” Inside the abandoned warehouse, mobsters scattered like cockroaches under a fluorescent light. Bullets pinged off crates and ricocheted through the gloom.  

He stood up, nonchalantly brushing glass off his suit. “Gentlemen, as much as I appreciate the impromptu bullet ballet, I left my tutu at home.”  

“Get him!” barked a thug with improbable mutton chops.  

Deadpool dodged a hail of gunfire, pirouetting through the air with all the grace of a deranged ballerina. He landed behind a stack of barrels, winking at the audience—no one in particular, but maybe you—or maybe just the dusty security camera drooping in the corner.  

He drew his katanas with a flourish. “All right, boys. Let’s make this PG-13. Nah, who am I kidding.” He vaulted the barrels, slicing through gun barrels and kicking pistols from trembling hands.  

The mutton-chopped goon rushed him with a crowbar. Deadpool sidestepped, caught the goon’s arm, and whispered, “Sorry, pal, but crowbars belong in clown college.” He flung the thug straight into a stack of counterfeit CDs labeled “Best of Smash Mouth.”  

Somewhere, a cellphone vibrated—“All Star” as the ringtone. Deadpool tucked a stray pistol behind his back, answering through his mask. “Deadpool speaking! No, I do NOT want to extend my car’s warranty–wait, what?”  

The phone sparked, fizzled. For a split-second, Deadpool caught a flicker in the air: a glitch, like reality’s tape snagging. The warehouse walls seemed to shimmer, and then—snap—it was gone. He stared.  

“That’s not in the script,” he muttered. Then, to us: “Did you see that? Seriously, if I start randomly turning into an anime girl, blame the writers.”  

He started forward, katanas at the ready, as the air crackled again. 302 333 Chapter 1 - Scene 1} ch1_sc2:{1 2 Deadpool shot up from his roll, dual katanas unsheathed before he touched the ground. “Greetings, illegal tax evaders!” he quipped, fingers waggling in salute. Around him, six hard-faced mobsters spun, their confusion as thick as the cologne in the air.  

“Who the hell—” barked the one in the pinstripe suit.  

Deadpool twirled his swords, heedless of guns being drawn. “Who am I? Glad you asked! Just your everyday crime-stopping, fourth-wall-busting, chimichanga-loving nightmare.” He winked directly at a broken security camera, as if its red recording light demanded acknowledgment.  

Bullets screamed. Deadpool pirouetted between crates, letting the mobsters’ aim slice new holes in the faded wallpaper. “Jeez, Tony! You can’t buy marksmanship like that. Actually, you totally can, but clearly you didn’t.” A round grazed his shoulder; he exaggerated a flinch. “Ah, my meat-shoulder! Now how will I carry my emotional baggage?”  

He vaulted over a crate, landing mere feet from a stammering thug. The man’s hand shook so badly his pistol clattered to the floor. Deadpool leaned in, conspiratorial: “Buddy, I know it’s intimidating sharing a scene with a charismatic antihero, but let’s work through those jitters together.” He elbowed the guy in the jaw with comical gentleness—enough to knock him out cold.  

Suddenly a heavier caliber tore through another crate and Deadpool ducked, faceplanting into a stack of stolen electronics. On his way down, he snatched a walkie-talkie, pressing the button with his chin. “This is Deadpool. Mobsters, one. Deadpool, all the points. Time to cash out, suckers.”  

He rolled to his feet just as the pinstripe boss hefted a rocket launcher. “Oh! New player enters the game,” Deadpool said, katanas raised. “Somebody’s compensating!”  

The boss grinned viciously—and squeezed the trigger. 282 333 Chapter 1 - Scene 2} ch1_sc3:{1 3 Deadpool winked directly at what might as well have been a camera—there wasn’t one, but you never know with narrative these days. “Alright, boys, here’s how this is gonna work. You all shoot, miss spectacularly, and I get to be the star, okay?” He twirled both katanas overhead, the blades humming with anticipation. 

The mobsters exchanged uncertain glances, guns wavering. The biggest of them—neck tattoo of a butterfly, guts of a jellyfish—growled, “Just shoot ‘im!”

They unloaded in a clattering storm of lead. Deadpool leaped behind a toppled slot machine, bullets pinging off the chrome. “Watch the hardware! Rent’s murder!” He stuck one sword out, clipping the ankle of an advancing goon who twisted midair and landed face-first on a lunch buffet. “Complimentary shrimp, buddy!”

Deadpool vaulted over the slot machine, somersaulting feet-first into another mobster’s chest. The thug crumpled with an OOMPH, Deadpool landing nimbly beside him. “One down, five to go. Six if we’re counting my inner child, but he’s already dead inside.”

Another mobster lunged, swinging a pool cue. Deadpool ducked, the cue whistling overhead. He snapped off a quick counter: “This isn’t a billiards hall, Jimmy Two-Sticks.” Deadpool seized the cue, broke it over his knee, and jabbed the splintered end at his attacker’s belt buckle. The man squealed and backpedaled.

Somewhere, glass shattered. “I was just about to suggest a ceasefire and brunch!” Deadpool hollered, backflipping over spilled chafing dishes, blades carving lazy arcs, disarming one gunman and flicking his gun into a nearby planter. “This is why we can’t have nice things.”

He paused, breathless and grinning, amid the chaos. The rest of the thugs circled, faces paling. Deadpool flourished his swords. “So…who’s next? Don’t all volunteer at once!” 

And as the scene teetered on the edge of more mayhem, the lights flickered ominously overhead. 301 333 Chapter 1 - Scene 3} ch20_sc1:{20 1 Deadpool inches down the warped staircase, his boots tapping three different materials: marble, shag carpet, and suspiciously sticky linoleum. He glances back—Rick shuffles behind him, ray gun ready, and Morty clings to the handrail like a terrified squirrel.

“Is it just me,” Deadpool whispers, “or does this place smell like comic book glue and broken dreams?”

Rick snorts. “That’s the scent of narrative entropy, dipstick. Means we’re close to the meta-core. Or Morty wet himself. Statistically, both.”

“Real funny, Grandpa,” Morty grumbles, tightening his grip. The walls around them flicker, scenes from their own pasts blurring in the wallpaper—Deadpool fighting in grayscale gutter space, Rick and Morty’s silhouettes running from yet another existential disaster.

A gash suddenly opens midair. From within, the villain—Dr. Panopticon—emerges, his cloak a storm of TV static and meme faces. “Ah, my favorite punchlines—arrived right on cue,” he purrs, voice layered like a sarcastic laugh track.

Deadpool spins his katanas. “Finally, somebody uglier than my last editor. And less likely to give me notes!”

Rick raises his ray gun. “Let’s skip the witty repartee, Four-Eyes. Too much meta-humor and the universe’s guts’ll blow out.”

Panopticon grins, stretching like a GIF. “That’s the idea, Sanchez. Without structure, all your little worlds will dissolve into punchlines with no setups. I’ll be the only joke that lasts.” His shadow spreads, slapping self-aware labels onto the steps: “Chekhov’s Gun Here,” “Foreshadowing Zone,” “Insert Flashback.”

“Uh, guys, I really don’t wanna fall through a plot hole,” Morty squeaks.

Deadpool winks. “That’s the spirit, kid! Nobody likes cliffhangers—unless they’re literal.” He leaps, swords out, aiming to sever the villain’s shimmering shadow. Rick flips a switch and blue light crackles. Panopticon only laughs, the stairwell shivering under his power—until everything jolts with a cinematic cut, and blackness swallows the scene. 297 333 Chapter 20 - Scene 1} ch20_sc2:{20 2 Morty clings to the banister, eyes wide as the world flickers between realities with every step. “Uh, guys? Does anyone else feel like they’re about to puke in three different timelines at once?”

Deadpool waves a hand, feigning calm. “Just keep your arms and existential crises inside the stairwell at all times, folks. If you see a version of yourself with a mustache, don’t trust him. He’s evil.” He winks at Morty—the kind of wink that never reassures anyone.

Rick grunts, squinting as the walls ripple, cycling through colors and textures like a bad fever dream. “The meta-oscillator’s close. Reality’s hemorrhaging both tropes and taste. Not that we had much of either to begin with.” His portal gun buzzes, its readings spiking between the numbers and tired punchlines.

A painting on the wall blinks—no, actually blinks—then sighs dramatically. “More fourth wall breakage? Do you guys ever just walk quietly?” Deadpool snaps off a two-finger salute. “Sorry, Mona Lisa, our sense of subtlety’s out of order. Try again next gas leak!”

Morty stumbles, stepping onto a stair that momentarily becomes a cartoon trampoline. He yelps, flailing to stay upright as the air fills with floating question marks. “Is…is this what having self-awareness feels like? I hate it!”

Rick yanks him back to solid ground, muttering, “Nothing new. You kids and your overexposed narrative devices.” He spins on Deadpool, tone sharp. “Listen. We overload the meta-oscillator, but if any of us gets too cute, reality goes full improv set. And no one wants to die in a deleted scene.”

Deadpool claps his hands, excitement and nerves leaking through. “Alright, final boss time. Who’s got the most unresolved personal trauma?”  

The staircase lands them in front of a door labeled: “No Plot Armor Beyond This Point.” All three pause. Deadpool gives a mock salute, Rick curses under his breath, and Morty just gulps, reaching for the handle. 314 333 Chapter 20 - Scene 2} ch20_sc3:{20 3 Deadpool sways on his feet, the shifting realities rendering his red-and-black suit almost fractal. “Morty, buddy, try gagging in at least one dimension *away* from me. Unless you want a new nickname. Multiversal Puke Machine sound good?”

Morty’s face goes pale, but he manages a weary glare. “I don’t—ugh—do this on purpose, Deadpool. My existential nausea has layers.”

Rick, leading the trio up a staircase that stripes itself in checkerboard and static as dimensions flicker, snorts. “You two are amateurs. Back in my day, the multiverse tried to kill you by *boredom*, not sudden nausea. Keep up!”

He punches buttons on the remote device duct-taped to his portal gun. The hallway shivers, paintings of Schrödinger's cats meowing in sync and their eyes following as the group staggers past.

Deadpool glances around, making exaggerated jazz hands. “Just a nice stroll to save all reality, folks! Nothing crazy. Paintings coming to life, gravity doing the cha-cha, Morty inventing new phobias—Tuesdays, am I right?”

Morty grabs the rail. “Why does everything feel thinner? Like—like the universe is giving up?”

Rick’s voice gets soft, for once. “Because it is, Morty. Fourth wall’s practically powder. Laws of physics are suggestions at this point. But if we stick to the plan, maybe, just maybe…” He trails off, eyes flicking to Deadpool.

Deadpool gives Rick a crooked thumbs-up. “Hey, worst case, we explode heroically and traumatize the audience. Best case, we—uh—get our existential issues solved via group hug?”

Rick huffs, but doesn’t say no.

They reach a door at the landing, shimmering and inscribed with cartoon speech bubbles. Beyond it: the heart of meta-chaos. Deadpool claps his hands together, grinning wide.

“Alright, weirdos. Showtime.”

He kicks the door open.

Light and static pour out, swallowing them whole. 290 333 Chapter 20 - Scene 3} ch2_sc1:{2 1 Deadpool zipped behind a stack of conveniently placed shipping crates, red suit barely a smear. Bullets sang through the air, pinging off metal and ricocheting into improbable locales—was that a takeout menu? “Nice grouping! You guys ever consider joining the Harlem Globetrotters?” he yelled, firing off a few rounds that missed spectacularly but looked gorgeous in slow-mo.

“I don’t think the Globetrotters use guns, dude!” hollered a thug, cradling an Uzi with the careful affection of someone who’d definitely not pass a background check.

Deadpool dove, rolling to his feet with exaggerated grace—if you could call colliding with a crate “grace.” He peered around, eyes narrowing behind his mask. “Let’s see… three goons left. One’s behind ‘Box of Chekhov’s Guns,’ one’s semi-conscious, and one guy’s realizing life insurance was a scam.” He cracked his knuckles, then his neck, then, for flavor, a glow stick. “Party time!”

He lunged. The first goon swung a pipe, missing Deadpool by a solid foot. Deadpool responded with a twirl worthy of a Broadway musical, smacking the thug upside the head with the butt of his own pistol. “And that’s what we call improvisational theater!” the merc crowed.

Gunman number two tried to get a bead, but tripped on the aforementioned takeout menu—now revealed to be extra greasy. He went down in a flurry of curses and lo mein. Deadpool didn’t even break stride as he stomped past, pausing only to lift a fortune cookie. “Your future holds… severe brain trauma. Ouch.”

The last goon, sweating bullets, aimed wildly. Deadpool sauntered up, unflappable. “Ever seen ‘The Matrix’?” he asked. The goon blinked, confused—then Deadpool disarmed him with a flourish and a wink to the imaginary audience.

“Dodge this,” Deadpool whispered, finger gun leveled—then flicked the goon’s forehead. The thug crumpled, one final laugh track echoing in Deadpool’s imagination as he strode toward the next corridor. 310 333 Chapter 2 - Scene 1} ch2_sc2:{2 2 Deadpool popped up from behind the crates like a gory Jack-in-the-box, twin katanas flashing in neon warehouse light. “Wow, you guys ever consider NOT shooting at the guy in red?” he chirped, ducking as another volley of bullets chewed through cardboard and splintered wood.

From the catwalk above, a burly thug in a ski mask bellowed, “Get him! Boss wants him alive!”

Deadpool rolled his eyes so hard it hurt. “Alive? Pfft, boring. You sure he doesn’t want, like, one chunk to put on his mantel?” He launched himself forward in an acrobatic whirl, slicing a pistol in half midair. The owner stared at what remained of his weapon, confusion written as clearly as the ketchup stains on Deadpool’s suit.

“Sorry, warranty probably doesn’t cover that,” Deadpool quipped, backflipping over a spilled crate of rubber chickens. They bounced everywhere, raising the surreal stakes.

A thug lunged. Deadpool kicked a chicken into his face. “FOWL play!” he crowed, then skewered another henchman’s sleeve to a wall. “Stick around! Oh—wrong franchise, sorry.”

Something crackled in Deadpool’s earpiece—static, then a voice weirdly reminiscent of a certain mad scientist. “Hey, jackass in red—move your ass to Bay 4. Now.”

Deadpool’s eyes widened inside the mask. “Unprompted advice from the great cosmic beyond? Or is my therapist finally returning my calls?” He leapt behind a forklift as heavy gunfire stitched lines across the concrete.

The warehouse shuddered, lights flickering. “Weird. That’s not foreshadowing at all,” Deadpool muttered. He peered over the forklift to see the last henchman drop his weapon and run.

Deadpool shrugged, then tiptoed toward Bay 4—because ignoring mysterious voices never did anybody any good. “Onward, to whatever lazy plot device awaits!” he called, vanishing around the corner as rubber chickens continued to bounce in his wake. 294 333 Chapter 2 - Scene 2} ch2_sc3:{2 3 A bullet zipped past Deadpool’s head, shaving a chunk off the crate behind him. “Hey!” he yelled. “That was my good side!” With a flourish, he swung himself upright atop the wooden box, arms out in mock surrender. “All right, I get it, gangsters gotta gangster. But before someone ventilates my pancreas, can we chat about the economics of villain henchmanship? Seriously, unionize.”

The goons exchanged uncertain looks, their bravado wilting under Deadpool’s manic grin. One—maybe promoted by accident—stepped forward with a machine gun. “Shut up, freak, or we—”

He didn’t get further. With a blur of red and silver, Deadpool’s katanas pinned the man’s sleeves to the wall behind him. “Hands where I can see ’em—or… sleeves,” Deadpool chirped, landing beside a mountain of dubious-looking crates. “Now someone tell me which of these boxes has the weapon so dangerous the plot summary alluded to it, and I promise not to decorate the walls with your internal organs. Today.”

Another henchman, sweating through his suit, stammered, “We—we don’t know anything, man! Some scientist paid us to keep people out!”

Deadpool hopped down, landing boot-to-chest on the quivering man. “A scientist, huh? Let me guess: neckbeard, lab coat, social skills of a coding bootcamp dropout?”

A sudden flash above—portal blue, rimmed with electronic sparks—cut him off. Deadpool paused, katanas halfway through a crate lid. “Aw, c’mon, not again,” he whined, as a spaceship-shaped something clanged to the floor in a shower of fast food wrappers and empty booze bottles.

From the sticky heap, a small, nervous voice piped, “Uh, Rick? Where are we? And… who’s the guy in the red pajamas?”

Deadpool turned, grinning even wider. “Oh, great. More players have entered the game.” 283 333 Chapter 2 - Scene 3} ch3_sc1:{3 1 Deadpool peeked over the splintered crate, katanas glinting behind him, surveying the warehouse’s new arrivals. Black-suited figures fanned out with guns drawn, each one with the same “Generic Multiversal Goons Local 399” logo on their sleeves. Deadpool couldn’t help himself.

“Wow, custom jackets? You guys unionized already? Color me—uh, bulletproof vest,” he quipped, hopping from his perch and rolling behind a stack of barrels as another hail of bullets sparked off the floor.

One goon shouted, “Cut the chatter and hand over the dimensional doohickey!”

Deadpool’s mask crinkled where his brow would be. “Dimensional doohickey?” He patted his pockets, producing: a rubber chicken, a half-eaten chimichanga, and—oops—a blinking device shaped suspiciously like a Rubik’s cube melted in a toaster. “You mean this?”

“She’s got the plot device!” another goon hollered, instantly prompting all weapons to train on him. Deadpool shrugged, tossing the device into the air and catching it behind his head like someone who both cared too little and too much.

“Let’s dance, boys,” he quipped, flinging a barrel into their path. Gunfire erupted; Deadpool zigzagged through it, leaping atop a fallen shelf, dual pistols blazing. Spent cartridges rained down in a glimmering arc.

One goon lunged. Deadpool tripped him with a sweeping kick, then ducked as a second swung a baton. “Ooh, melee combat! I rate this two out of five stars for effort.”

Suddenly, a bottle green portal fizzled open midair with the sound of a slurping straw. Out tumbled Rick—drunk, burping, and aiming a portal gun at Deadpool’s head. Behind him, Morty skidded to a stop, wide-eyed.

Rick looked around, unperturbed by the chaos. “Aw jeez, who invited Red Power Ranger?” he sneered.

Deadpool grinned. “Costume party, old man. You bringing punch or just the body odor?”

The warehouse crackled with tension—a standoff, primed to explode. 300 333 Chapter 3 - Scene 1} ch3_sc2:{3 2 Rick’s portal fizzed out behind them with a damp, fizzling pop, leaving Deadpool, Morty, and Rick momentarily surrounded by the eerie silence of the warehouse, shattered wood still raining down from Rick’s less-than-dignified entrance. Then the black-suited figures moved in formation, steps inhumanly synchronized. Their guns didn’t waver, and the name tags all read: “Generic Multiversal Henchman #...”

“Aw, c’mon, now that’s just lazy writing!” Deadpool shouted, gesturing at the swarm. One of the henchmen cocked his head.

“We’re cost-effective and ambiguous, sir,” the lead one droned in a voice like an over-caffeinated GPS.

Rick grunted, eyes never leaving the glint of their gun barrels. “Morty, remember—if bullets fly, duck behind your own existential dread.”

“Rick!” Morty hissed. “That’s not a thing you can—”

A hail of bullets erupted before Morty could finish. Rick flicked his portal gun at the floor, unleashing a lopsided bubble of green energy that splashed out to form a shimmering, makeshift shield. Bullets slapped against it with cartoonish *pwang!*s. Deadpool dove and rolled, katanas flashing, bisecting a henchman mid-run.

“Do you guys even have insurance?” Deadpool called out, kicking away a severed plastic gun.

The lead Generic Henchman’s tie fluttered. “Union says you’ll be paying for this, sir.”

Morty cowered behind a stack of broken crates as Rick peered around the shield. “Okay, plan: improvise.”

“Improvise is my middle name!” Deadpool whooped, leaping atop a crate. “Also, Francis, but that’s a long story. Who’s with me?”

Rick aimed his portal gun at the ceiling, thinking. “I’m issuing a distraction order: go nuts, Deadpool.”

Morty shot Rick a mortified look. “What about me?”

“You’re comic relief, buddy. Keep your head down.”

Deadpool grinned under his mask. “Best. Team-up. Ever.”

And with that, all hell broke loose. 290 333 Chapter 3 - Scene 2} ch3_sc3:{3 3 Morty shuffled his feet uneasily, casting nervous glances at the splintered rafters above. “S-So, uh, what now? We just stand around until the existential dread kicks in, or…?”

Deadpool bent over, brushing wood dust from his shoulder. “Kid, the existential dread is like cable—always running in the background. But hey, at least we have each other! Nothing like a little found family, right?” He waggled his eyebrows behind his mask.

Rick, ignoring them both, rummaged through the cracked crates with a grumble. “If either of you talks about feelings, I’m opening a portal straight into a supermassive black hole. And you’re both going first.”

He tossed aside a crate lid, revealing an unsettling device covered in blinking lights and scribbled warnings. Deadpool sidled up, poking at the buttons. “Ooh. Is this the part where the mysterious object ominously advances the plot?” He grinned, voice bouncing with glee. “I hope it explodes.”

“Don’t touch that!” Rick barked, snatching the device away. “This thing could destabilize reality—more than you two idiots already have. I just need—”

Morty cut in, voice trembling but determined. “Rick, look, if this, uh, whatever-it-is, can get us back home, can you just do it? I don’t wanna get erased by meta-jokes or whatever.”

Rick fixed Morty with a rare, almost gentle gaze, then turned to Deadpool. “You. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve ever survived?”

Deadpool leaned against a half-collapsed pillar, appraising Rick. “Define ‘survived.’ Physically? Emotionally? Mentally? Spoiler alert: failed the last two. But hey, keep it moving, Drunky McScience.”

Rick cracked the faintest smile, tools whirring. “Then buckle up, boys. We’re going hunting for the punchline behind all this. Try not to die—unless you’re into that sort of thing.”

Morty sucked in a breath as reality flickered. The room’s shadows crawled, hinting that they weren’t alone after all. 302 333 Chapter 3 - Scene 3} ch4_sc1:{4 1 Morty watched in alarm as Deadpool vaulted up onto the cracked countertop, red boots squelching in something that might once have been orange juice. “All right, multiverse breakfast meeting!” Deadpool declared, arms spread wide. “Rule one: ricochets are encouraged. Rule two: whoever says ‘what could possibly go wrong’ gets a surprise wedgie.” He swung his swords for emphasis, narrowly missing a plastic dinosaur.

Rick, slumped against the fridge with a beer can instantly manifesting in his hand, belched. “I’m not collecting infinity stones with a cosplaying nutcase who narrates his own inner monologue, just saying.”  
“Aw, c’mon, Rick! He’s—uh—we might need his, like, expertise in…chaos?” Morty squeaked, eyes flicking between the two.

Deadpool landed beside Morty, close enough for Morty to smell gunpowder…and maybe tacos? “Morty gets it! That’s why he’s the fan-favorite.” Deadpool gave Morty a light punch on the arm. “We’ll come up with a plan. Preferably one with more explosions than last time.”

Rick rolled his eyes and eyed a broken portal gun part on the table. “Plan number one: Find whoever—or whatever—merged our realities before the multiverse does that thing where it folds in on itself and turns all known matter into hot pockets.”  
“Did someone say Hot Pockets?” Deadpool’s head snapped around, hopeful.

Morty cleared his throat, trying to sound braver than he felt. “R-right, so, step one: figure out who’s messing with the fabric of reality. Step two: don’t die. Step three: do we even have a step three?”

“Step three,” Rick muttered, “is don’t listen to Deadpool’s step two.”

Deadpool grinned. “Spoil my fun, why don’t you. But I agree with Rick for once—let’s raid the garage for gadgets. Or at least matching jumpsuits.”

Rick scoffed, but Morty, with Deadpool at his side, found himself smiling despite the rubble and the chaos. For the first time, this team-up almost sounded…kind of fun. 309 333 Chapter 4 - Scene 1} ch4_sc2:{4 2 Morty’s eyes widened as Deadpool, standing triumphantly atop the counter, began using a spatula as a makeshift microphone. “Good morning, my trans-dimensional test subjects!” he called out, gesturing dramatically. Rick groaned, ignoring him in favor of stirring a questionable green liquid in a beaker, his lab coat stained with what might have been ketchup—or possibly blood.

“Wade, what the hell are you doing on my kitchen counter?” Rick snapped, not looking up.

Deadpool grinned behind his mask. “Running the most important strategy meeting of our lives! Also, providing excellent aerobic exercise for your fruit flies. You’re welcome.”

Morty shrank back into his chair, glancing warily at Deadpool’s swords, the tip of one currently teetering between his pancakes. “Uh… what’s the plan, exactly?”

Rick yanked the beaker off its burner, sending a puff of purple steam curling into the air. “The plan is to get the hell out of this mess before breakfast becomes brunch. Meta-humor manipulator is already tearing holes in reality. And now—you.” He gestured accusingly at Wade. “—have somehow made things worse.”

Deadpool jumped down, landing with exaggerated superhero flair. “You say potato, I say plot potato,” he quipped, kicking aside a half-melted spatula. “Look, if we’re gonna stop Mister Mimesis from turning all of existence into a live-action meme, we gotta work together! That means… team-building exercises!” He flashed two thumbs up.

Rick looked horrified. “Nope. Absolutely not. If I wanted therapy, I’d replace my frontal lobe with a folding chair and just sit on my own face.”

Morty hesitated, the absurdity of the moment almost too much. Still, he managed, “Guys? Do we have an actual plan that doesn’t involve trust falls or… whatever Deadpool’s doing?”

Deadpool winked. “I call this move the ‘Dysfunctional Family Breakfast!’”

Rick dropped his beaker, glass shattering.

A portal sparked to life in the corner of the kitchen. 307 333 Chapter 4 - Scene 2} ch4_sc3:{4 3 Morty blinked twice, as if recalibrating to find Deadpool holding court in the Smith kitchen. Rick, head deep in the fridge, muttered, “This is why breakfast vodka needs to be stronger.” Summer, still in pajamas, just rolled her eyes and poured cereal. 

Deadpool scanned the audience. “I’ll be your host, MC, and potential new stepdad if your mom plays her cards right!” He winked at nobody in particular, brandishing the spatula. “Can I get a round of applause for reality’s flimsiest barriers?” He gestured broadly, causing milk to slosh dangerously close to the edge of Morty’s bowl.

Morty edged away. “Uh, is he always like this?” he whispered to Summer.

“Apparently, it gets worse,” Summer sighed.

Rick re-emerged, clutching a suspiciously glowing bottle. “Wade, if you’re gonna wreck my house, at least be useful. You know how to make eggs on six simultaneous temporal vectors?” 

Deadpool curtsied. “For you, Rick, I’ll scramble space-time for breakfast.” He threw three eggs into the air, expertly snatching the first two midair and ignoring the third as it splattered onto Jerry’s shirt—Jerry, who had just walked in and immediately retreated, muttering something about ‘weird dreams.’

Ignoring the mess, Deadpool cracked his fictitious knuckles. “Now, as part of your morning orientation: Evil just broke the fourth wall. Reality’s got plot holes, continuity errors, and maybe a few angry fanfics leaking in. Sound familiar?” 

Rick squinted. “You’re saying someone’s weaponized meta-humor?”

Deadpool nodded sagely, spatula on heart. “And we need to out-meta the meta, or kaput—no more reruns or spinoffs for anybody.”

Morty bit his lip. “So, we save the multiverse?”

“Save it, maybe autograph it, definitely get tacos after,” Deadpool replied.

Summer tossed her hair. “All this before coffee. Rad.”

As Deadpool leapt from the counter, pointing his spatula toward cosmic adventure, Rick grinned, the first spark of professional curiosity kindling in his eyes. The unlikely team’s breakfast had just become their first war council. 320 333 Chapter 4 - Scene 3} ch5_sc1:{5 1 Morty stood in the doorway, clutching a cereal box to his chest like a pathetic shield. “So, uh, you’re really Deadpool? Not like some weird shapeshifter or—oh god—Cronenberg thing?”

Deadpool didn’t miss a beat, dramatically bowing over the kitchen island. “Only the real deal, kid. Still waiting on someone to roll out the red carpet and a commemorative mug, though!” He flapped a gloved hand towards Summer, who rolled her eyes from behind her phone.

Rick slammed the fridge shut, brandishing a carton of something suspiciously unlabeled. “If I cared, which—spoiler alert—I don’t, I’d ask how you even got in here. But dimension-hopping randos showing up is basically Tuesday now.” He poured the ‘milk’—questionable viscosity—into his mug instead of the cereal bowl, then topped it off with clear vodka from his coat.

Deadpool sidled up to him, exaggeratedly sniffing the concoction. “Breakfast cocktail? Mind if I—” He reached for the mug; Rick zapped his hand with a little blue device.

“Touch my science juice and the only fourth wall you’ll be breaking is your own femur, jackass.”

Morty cautiously set his cereal on the counter, glancing between his grandpa and the costumed assassin. “Wait, so, does this mean like, our universe is in danger? Or are you just here to—uh—do a guest spot or something?”

Deadpool cocked a finger gun at him. “Both! But word of advice, Mort: if a mustache-twirling jackass in a plot-hole cape shows up? Run.”

Summer briefly looked up. “Just promise not to trash the house before cheer practice, okay?”

Rick grumbled, “Too late; existential dread’s already leaking under the doors.”

Deadpool perched on a chair, swinging his legs. “Alright, team! Next step: totally normal strategy meeting. Or pancake breakfast. Whichever requires fewer existential police chases.”

The family exchanged looks. It was going to be a very long morning. 303 333 Chapter 5 - Scene 1} ch5_sc2:{5 2 Deadpool flopped onto Rick’s battered couch as if auditioning for a mattress commercial—if the mattress was lumpy, smelled faintly of pickle brine, and had definitely witnessed war crimes. He propped his boots on the cluttered coffee table, scattering a constellation of nuts, bolts, and what was probably a sentient toaster crumb. His mask twisted into a playful grin.

“I mean, look at me! Accept no substitutions, kiddo,” Deadpool crowed, finger-gunning Morty with comic-book panache. “No lizard man, no body horror. Just Canada’s finest unstable export.” He plucked the cereal box from Morty’s grip and squinted at the label, grimacing. “These are gross. Is everything in this dimension…sad?”

Morty stammered, “Uh, depends. Are you gonna start shooting? Because the last time Rick brought home a weird guy in red spandex—”

“Morty! Stop being a little drama-sponge and get me the laser wrench!” Rick barked, emerging from the kitchen with a flask and a live, mildly offended rat dangling from his other hand. “Deadpool, ignore him. Or don’t. I literally don’t care.”

Deadpool, now upside-down on the couch like an enthusiastic gymnast, called, “Hey, Rick! Did your portal gun always make that weird coughing noise, or is it allergies season for fictional technology?”

Rick slumped beside him, joint popping like bubble wrap. “It’s your fault my gun’s coughing up multiversal hairballs. Meta-humor pollution, jackass.” The rat scurried free, dropping a tiny monocle as it fled.

Morty hesitated, then pressed the laser wrench into Rick’s outstretched palm. “So… what’s the plan? There is a plan, right?”

Deadpool spread his arms wide, inviting chaos. “The plan is: we wing it and pray the author isn’t off their meds.” He winked at the ceiling. “I’m looking at you, text monkey!”

Rick slugged his flask, rattled the portal gun, and managed a smirk. “Let’s break something. Maybe fate itself.”

The couch creaked under the weight of mischief. 311 333 Chapter 5 - Scene 2} ch5_sc3:{5 3 Deadpool’s boots dangled over the armrest. He twirled Rick’s disintegrator gun in his hands, marveling at the gaudy green LEDs. “So, is this set to ‘Swiss cheese’ or ‘existential crisis’? Because if it’s the second one, pretty sure Morty already beat you to it.”

Rick ignored him, frantically pawing through piles of gizmos and half-finished gadgets littering the living room. “Don’t touch that, pool noodle! If you trigger that thing inside the house, you’ll punch a hole in the space-time continuum and land us in a universe that runs on interpretive dance.”

Across the room, Morty peeked nervously from behind a stack of radioactive VHS tapes. “Uh, guys? Maybe we should…I dunno, make a plan?” He looked from his nihilist grandfather to the mercenary in red and seemed to reconsider suggesting any course of action.

“Plans are for people who can’t improvise,” Deadpool quipped, pointing finger guns at Morty. “But hey, you do you, kid. What’s the worst that could happen? Meta-villain erases us from all timelines and we end up in a Family Guy cutaway gag?”

Rick’s belch punctuated the air. “The only thing worse than that would be getting stuck in a CW crossover special. Morty, find the intermittently stable portal gun. Deadpool—put the disintegrator down before I turn your insides into taffy.”

Deadpool shrugged, tossing the gun with perfectly reckless aim. Rick snatched it mid-air, grumbling. “Cute. Next time I’ll recalibrate it to vaporize wisecracks.”

Morty started rifling frantically. Deadpool faced the fourth wall, voice dropping. “You ever notice how every crisis comes down to ‘find the widget, save the world’? Beginning to think my life’s getting written by a neural network with a thing for lampshading.”

Rick, unamused, muttered, “If you’re done with your Shakespeare in the Park, I could use an extra pair of hands over here.”

Deadpool slid off the couch, dramatic. “Fine. Cue the heist music. But if we end up in a montage again, I’m billing somebody.”

Morty found the portal gun. "Got it!"

They exchanged nervous, expectant looks—the calm before absurdity. 340 333 Chapter 5 - Scene 3} ch6_sc1:{6 1 Morty watched Deadpool with a mix of awe and unease as the merc twirled the gun dangerously close to his own face. “Uh, Deadpool? Maybe don’t point that at your—” Morty’s voice faltered as Deadpool cheered, pressing something at random. A green laser shot out and sliced a chunk off the faux-Velvet Elvis painting behind them.

Rick jerked up from under the console, half-buried in tangle of wires. “Hey! Watch it, Pool Boy! That’s genuine interdimensional kitsch!”

Deadpool shrugged, tossing the gun from one hand to the other. “Relax, gramps. These fingers are insured. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? The universe explodes and we all get rebooted with slightly worse casting?”

Morty cringed. “Please don’t give the universe ideas.”

Rick snatched the gun from Deadpool, eyeing him up and down. “You break my stuff again, and I’ll stick your regenerative nose where the sun don’t shine, capisce?” He jammed the gun into a holster, then flicked a switch on the dashboard. The lights in the room flickered, and a portal hummed to life in the corner.

Deadpool spun dramatically to face the swirling green vortex. “At last! Adventure! Angst! Vitamin D!” He made a running leap—

—and tripped over an empty flask, colliding headfirst into the snack shelf. Bags of Portal Pringles cascaded over him.

Morty burst out laughing in spite of himself. “Dude! Are you, like, indestructible everywhere except your dignity?”

Deadpool, sprawled and buried under chips, gave Morty a thumbs up. “It regenerates faster than you think.”

Rick rolled his eyes, stepping over Deadpool’s legs to grab a portal remote. “All right, idiots. Everybody ready? Next stop: meta-horror mode. Try not to break anything. Again.”

Deadpool stood, brushing fake cheese dust from his suit. “No promises, grandpa.”

With that, they stepped toward the portal, the flickering green light swallowing them as the room dissolved behind. 309 333 Chapter 6 - Scene 1} ch6_sc2:{6 2 Morty watched Deadpool with a mix of awe and unease as the merc twirled the gun dangerously close to his own face. “Uh, Deadpool? Maybe don’t point that at your—” Morty’s voice faltered as Deadpool abruptly clicked the trigger. A dazzling flag marked BANG! popped out of the barrel. Deadpool grinned manically. “Relax, kid. Comedy gold. Also, I’m basically unkillable. Annoying, right? Yeah, I thought so too.”

Rick snorted, hunched over the dubious-looking device sprawled across the garage table. “I’ve seen better sight gags from space clowns. And trust me—they don’t get the punchlines either.” He yanked a glowing cable loose, which only made the blue readout on his portal gun blip more frantically.

Deadpool flounced over, practically bouncing. “What’s this? Ooh, is that the multiversal flux inverter, or the blender? Because it’s about time for daiquiris. Wait, wait—press that one!”

Morty interjected, edging away from the swirling vortex at the corner of the room. “Guys, shouldn’t we focus on, y’know, NOT getting erased from existence? Maybe less button-pressing, more—careful… science stuff?”

A tiny portal hiccupped and spat out a rubber chicken, which flopped limply on the floor. Deadpool pounced, brandishing it like a sword. “A-ha! The Weaponized Humor Strikeforce assembles!”

Rick rolled his eyes so hard Morty worried they might actually escape their sockets. “The ‘villain’ is feeding off the entropy we create every time one of us cracks a joke. You want to win? Try shutting up for five minutes.”

Deadpool froze mid-quip. Morty glanced nervously between them.

A tremor rippled through the floor, rattling every beaker in the room. Something—some *presence*—seemed to loom just beyond the boundaries of reality.

Deadpool’s grip tightened on the rubber chicken. “Guess we’re about to meet the meta-monster.”

Rick raised his portal gun, the targeting matrix glowing an ominous shade. “Showtime, kids.” 300 333 Chapter 6 - Scene 2} ch6_sc3:{6 3 Morty’s warning froze on his lips as Deadpool cheerfully swung the gun in a circle, then abruptly paused. “Relax, kiddo! Fourth wall’s got my back. Also, probably my frontal cortex, but I never checked.” He grinned, his mask crinkling, and shot a wink at the nonexistent camera, earning an exasperated groan from Rick.

“We don’t have time for one of your—whatever these breakdowns are supposed to be, Pool,” Rick grumbled, tinkering with a flickering device shaped like a toaster welded to a remote control. Sparks shot out. “Meta-humor won’t short out the Over-Narrator’s cannon.”

Deadpool sauntered closer, holstering his weapon with a theatrical twirl like a washed-up rodeo clown. “You keep saying ‘Over-Narrator’ like that means anything to the audience. Unless this chapter is sponsored by Wikipedia, maybe define your terms, Doc Brown.”

Rick rolled his eyes so hard it looked like an act of physics-defying rebellion. “It’s the entity responsible for the collapsing realities, smartass. It’s feeding on our awareness—the more we notice the tropes, the stronger it gets.”

Morty hovered glumly behind them, wringing his hands. “So being, you know, self-aware is what’s killing everything?” His voice trembled. “You guys are like, super good at that.”

Deadpool squatted to Morty’s level. “Buddy, you don’t survive this long without jokes, inner monologues, and excessive genre referentiality. But maybe—just spitballing—we should try… sincerity for once? Like, actual emotions?” He shuddered theatrically.

Rick sneered, hiding real uncertainty. “Fine, let’s weaponize feelings. Worked for Care Bears. Morty, fetch the… whatever. I’m busy creating a multiversal disruptor. Deadpool, try not to break physics.”

Morty scampered off. Deadpool stood beside Rick, both staring at the sparking invention.

“You ever worry the only thing holding us together is the gaffer tape of irony?” Deadpool mused quietly.

Rick’s response was soft, almost missed under the hum of the machine.  
“Every damn day, Wade.”

The device surged, bathing them in flickering ultraviolet light… 316 333 Chapter 6 - Scene 3} ch7_sc1:{7 1 Morty tried to steady his trembling hand as he entered the neon-lit corridor, trailing behind Deadpool. The walls shimmered with streaks of glitching code; occasional pop-ups blinked midair—a disembodied fortune cookie declared, “This moment brought to you by product placement!” before imploding in a shower of digital confetti.

Deadpool stopped short, causing Morty to stumble and nearly collide with his red-and-black suit. "Welcome to the Nexus of Narrative Inconsistencies!" Wade announced, arms wide as if unveiling a theme park nobody wanted to visit. “Mind the plot holes—they bite.”

Morty nervously glanced behind them. “Uh, Deadpool, are you sure this is the way? Last time Rick and I ended up somewhere like this, we got stuck in a bottle episode for, like, four weeks…”

Deadpool grinned beneath his mask. “Bottle episodes build character, kid. This is where all the worlds go to glitch out before the writers retcon ‘em away. It’s the original dumpster fire.”

A flicker at the hall’s end caught Morty’s eye: a hulking silhouette, industrial and menacing, materializing from the static. The villain—Meta-Monger—stood, face obscured by a cube of shifting memes, voice echoing in overlapping remixes of internet catchphrases. “You think a little meta-awareness makes you immune, Wade?” it intoned, tone oscillating like a corrupted file. “I’m the punchline. You’re the setup.”

Without warning, Deadpool whipped out his swords. “Chill, Tron reject. The kid and I were just passing through—got any directions to the nearest plot device?”

Meta-Monger’s cube flickered, distorting the space around them. Panels peeled back, exposing sketches and script notes that threatened to rewrite reality.

Morty swallowed. “Oh man, Rick’s really not going to believe this—assuming we make it out.”

“Relax, Morty! Worst comes to worst, we get rebooted.” Deadpool winked at the audience. “Which is usually my Tuesday.”

The cube hummed, energy crackling. The walls began to unravel. 304 333 Chapter 7 - Scene 1} ch7_sc2:{7 2 Morty jerked back as a sentient “404 ERROR” sign buzzed past his head, cackling in a digital squeal. “Uh, Deadpool? Does it usually look like the world’s auditioning for a glitchcore TikTok?”

Deadpool twirled his katanas like an impatient baton twirler, half-waltzing through swirling polygons that phased in and out of existence. “Kid, in my line of work, this is like Monday brunch after tequila. Stick close, and remember: If the code starts flirting with you, just swipe left.”

Lights flickered across Morty’s face; the hallway rippled beneath his sneakers, floors rearranging—a staircase morphing into a slide then flattening into what appeared to be a carpet of animated memes. “Oh geez. Why is Shrek winking at me?”

Deadpool paused, puncturing a pop-up ad with his sword. Confetti and ‘SUBSCRIBE!’ buttons rained down. “Ignore Shrek. Focus! We’re looking for the Meta Mainframe. Vic says if you poke it hard enough, it coughs up plot devices like furballs.” He elbowed a floating search bar. “Hey, Google Maps? Give us the route to ‘Villains With Big Egos HQ.’”

The search bar snorted and zipped off. Morty’s voice wavered. “You’re sure Rick’s even in here? This place feels like an internet fever dream, man.”

“Trust me, kid. Nihilistic grandpas are like malware—always hiding in the source code. We just gotta keep breaking stuff ’til he crawls out.”

Suddenly, the corridor’s shimmering walls warped, pixelating into jagged comics panels. Word bubbles drifted like clouds: “WHAM!” “SNARK!” “RETCON!” A hollow laugh rolled down the tunnel.

Deadpool cocked an eyebrow at Morty. “Showtime, sidekick. Somebody’s using meta-humor as a laser grid maze. You ready to dodge punchlines?”

Morty gulped, clutching his portal gun. “As I’ll ever be.”

They stepped into the shifting maze, one foot in reality, the other skidding on satire—intent on not becoming the next joke themselves. 302 333 Chapter 7 - Scene 2} ch7_sc3:{7 3 Deadpool stopped mid-stride, staring slack-jawed as the swirling code of the multiverse flickered around them. Panels of comic art peeled away like errant wallpaper, exposing raw, pulsating grids beneath. “Y’know, I didn’t mind a little fourth-wall shenanigans, but this is starting to feel like a techno rave in a blender,” he quipped, spinning his katanas for comfort.

Rick was hunched over his portal gun, furiously recalibrating the dials. “Someone’s jamming the multiversal frequency with meta-constructs. Reality’s undergoing *editorial revision*, and we’re ground zero.” His face was all determination and eye bags.

Morty gazed around with wide eyes. Giant floating hashtags and scrolling ‘LAUGH TRACK’ banners twisted overhead like storm clouds. “Uh—guys, I think I’m allergic to this much irony.”

A pixelated version of Deadpool zipped by, trailing exaggerated winks and airhorn memes. Deadpool tackled it, arms flailing. “Finally, some competition! Gimme back my *brand*, poser!”

The fake ‘Pool dissolved into a mess of error messages, shrieking “LOL SORRY, CANON VIOLATION” before evaporating.

Morty edged closer to Rick. “So, what’s the plan? I-I’m not ready to get deleted by a snarky subtitle.”

Rick eyed the unraveling horizon, grimacing. “We override the punchline engine. I get us to the nucleus. Deadpool, you’ll need to cut through a few jokes—literally. Morty, just… try not to existentially combust.”

Deadpool straightened, twirling a katana. “Heroic sacrifice vibe, got it. Been there, stabbed that. Lead the way, Doc—before my speech bubbles start quoting Garfield.”

Just then, a hole tore in the pixelated floor, revealing a descending staircase with ‘PLOT PROGRESSION’ flickering in neon.

Rick cocked an eyebrow. “Well, subtlety’s dead. Let’s move.”

They sprinted toward the stairs, the world reformatting behind them as they dove into the next layer of madness. 285 333 Chapter 7 - Scene 3} ch8_sc1:{8 1 The air rippled with static, every breath tinged with ozone and the scent of overused punchlines. Deadpool’s gloved fingers curled into a fist, his eyes darting between the shifting grids overhead and Rick, who was busy calibrating a whirring device that looked suspiciously like a blender with too many antennas.

“So, we’re just gonna ignore the fact reality’s coming apart like a cheap piñata at a kid’s birthday?” Deadpool quipped, trying to keep things light—and mostly failing. His voice bounced off the exposed code, warping in weirdly satisfying ways.

Morty flinched, pressing himself closer to Rick’s lab coat. “Uh, Rick? Exactly how screwed are we on a scale from ‘Disney lawsuit’ to ‘existential void?’”

Rick didn’t look up. “Morty, language. Also, we’re so far past screwed that—” He jabbed at the device, making it sputter, then catch, emitting a sound like a sitcom laugh track in reverse. “—it’s basically experimental jazz at this point. Just hold still.”

Deadpool arched an eyebrow behind his mask. “You know, I’m used to reality breakdowns, Rick. But usually, the only thing peeling is my skin.”

Rick snorted. “What’s peeling now is your sense of narrative importance. Shut up for a sec—”

He slammed a button. The world convulsed. Panels tore away, revealing not characters, but thought bubbles tangled in a knot—sentences looping endlessly, all self-referential. Deadpool reached out, his hand passing through one, feeling the words tingle across his wrist.

“Feels... itchy,” he muttered. “Anyone else itchy?”

Morty shook his head, wide-eyed. “No, just terrified.”

Rick grinned, wild and unhinged. “Perfect. The meta-humor algorithm’s losing cohesion. If we push it any further, the villain’s hiding spot might just—”

A bolt of neon logic zipped overhead, splitting another panel with a deafening *crack*.

Deadpool cocked his head. “You were saying?”

Rick cocked the device like a shotgun. “I’m saying: get ready to jump.” 308 333 Chapter 8 - Scene 1} ch8_sc2:{8 2 The static crackled louder as Rick stepped forward, portal gun raised but uncharacteristically twitchy. "Okay, I don’t like this. Holomatrix reality is fluctuating—Morty, keep Deadpool from licking the walls."

Deadpool, hand mysteriously sticky, winked behind his mask. "No promises, grandpa. This much meta-energy is basically a free buffet for my trauma."

Morty sidestepped, glancing warily at a corridor that flickered between sitcom living room and dystopian wasteland. "I-I-I think we should stick together," he said, voice quivering. "Whatever’s controlling this place could, like, turn us into a running gag or just delete us—"

From a shifting mural overhead, a cartoon mouth sprouted and spoke. “Careful, boys! Everything you say can—and will—be used against you in the court of meta-narrative law!”

Deadpool cocked an imaginary gun with a click. “Ooo, I’d love my day in meta-court. Objection! My client—me—is too handsome for prison.”

Rick grunted, flicking his wrist to scan the surroundings. Holographic errors rippled around his device. "F***. We’re on a logic collapse countdown. Any more reality jokes and—well—"

The walls, offended by the banter, began dropping into panels of black-and-white comic strips, hiding exit doors with layers of punchline graffiti. A shadowy figure darted just out of sight, trailed by a ribbon of neon text: [INSERT PLOT TWIST HERE].

Deadpool leapt forward, blades flashing. “Time for that third-act confrontation! C’mon, Rick—Morty—you bring the nervous energy, I’ll bring the ultra-violence!”

Morty yelped as a flying pie shot past his head, spat out by a story-panel. “Why is everything trying to kill us with slapstick now?”

Rick grinned with sudden clarity, eyes glinting. “That’s it, Morty. Deadpool—their weapon’s comedy. Ours is chaos. Ready to flip the script?”

Deadpool’s mask stretched in a grin. “I was born ready. Literally. My monologue started at birth.”

In that moment, the villain’s laughter echoed—beckoning them deeper into the multiversal labyrinth. 305 333 Chapter 8 - Scene 2} ch8_sc3:{8 3 Rick’s left eye spasmed as currents of azure static spiderwebbed across the flickering walls. Morty cringed behind him, clutching the leftover taco Deadpool had conjured up from somewhere unspeakable. The oppressive buzz of the collapsing holomatrix reality began to strain through their teeth.

Deadpool, for his part, was hopping between the busted neon tiles like some anarchic game of hopscotch. “Guys, you ever get that tingling sensation? Y’know, like your atoms might turn into nacho cheese at any moment? Because—woo!—I think I’m dripping.”

Rick gritted his teeth, adjusting a slider on the portal gun. “If your atoms cheese out, at least you’ll taste better than your one-liners.”

Morty shot Rick a pleading look. “Grandpa, can you fix this before we all end up as, uh, existential fondue?”

Before Rick could retort, a new fissure ripped across the ceiling. From the ragged gap, cartoonish word bubbles tumbled down—‘BOOM!’, ‘LOL!’, and ‘???’. They spun around Deadpool’s head in dizzying orbit.

Deadpool, undeterred, snatched a bubble midair. “‘LOL’? C’mon, even my inner monologue is phoning it in.” He squished the bubble; it popped with a wet raspberry.

“Okay, that settles it. Reality’s going full meta meltdown,” Rick muttered. He surveyed the crackling air, then fired up the portal gun—and nothing happened. The device spasmed in his hand, coughing up a plume of glitter and a faint laugh track.

“Aw jeez…,” Morty whimpered, shrinking closer to Deadpool out of reflex.

The static swelled. Reality yawned wide. For a fractured heart-pounding instant, all three found themselves staring past the veil—at outlines of panels, rows of script notes, and even the glint of a cosmic editor’s red pen.

Then, just as quickly, the fissure snapped shut. The word bubbles fizzled out. Everything seemed to freeze, breathless. Deadpool grinned, unruffled. “Anyone else feel like we just got rebooted?”

Rick’s glare could’ve burned through the multiverse. “No more jokes. We’re outta time.” 314 333 Chapter 8 - Scene 3} ch9_sc1:{9 1 The laboratory reeked of ozone and taco grease. Deadpool kicked an errant test tube toward a quivering portal generator in the center of the chaos. “So, Rick, you ever think about inventing a ‘Make All This Not-Happen’ gun, or do you just wing it with science and a surly attitude?”

Rick flicked the back of his hand, slinging a splatter of blue fluid onto a console. “Morty, tape the trans-dimensional relay. Deadpool, keep your trigger finger off anything that glows. Every wavelength of reality is about to get seared through a punchline-shaped loophole.”

Morty fumbled for the duct tape, nervously glancing at the sparking machinery. “Uh, Grandpa Rick, is that… normal?” A ripple of static arced from one device to the taco Deadpool had stashed in Morty’s grip, causing it to pulse neon pink.

“Tacos aren’t supposed to do that, right?” Deadpool poked it, half-hopeful, half-horrified. “If this thing eats my hand, I want royalties.”

Rick ignored him, wrenching wires and muttering, “Fourth-wall destabilization—a quantum comedy cascade. We’re at ground zero for a meta meltdown. If we don’t–”

Suddenly, the lights flickered. The portal generator groaned, coughing up a jagged rift. Through it, a shadowy figure smirked—a vaguely familiar silhouette, ringed in cartoon speech bubbles that spun like razor blades.

“Oh great,” Deadpool muttered. “A gag villain.”

The villain’s voice boomed, layered and glitched, as if dubbed by thirteen sarcastic narrators at once. “You thought the joke was on me. But I am the joke. I am the chaos behind the punchline!”

Rick threw a glance at Deadpool. “Is it too late to return you to the factory with a recall notice?”

Morty yelped as the taco in his hands began reciting knock-knock jokes in a demonic voice. All three braced themselves as the villain stepped forward, the edges of the fourth wall crumbling behind them, reality bending with each word. 311 333 Chapter 9 - Scene 1} ch9_sc2:{9 2 Morty peeked nervously over a pile of scorched binders as Rick feverishly soldered wires into the blinking, jury-rigged shell of the portal generator. Deadpool, tapping a katana on his shoulder like a bored shopper in the world’s most hazardous Costco, meandered through the debris with the air of someone looking for trouble, or maybe just the remote.

"So... this is the big fix-it plan?" Deadpool jabbed a toe at the generator. "Reminds me of my sophomore science project. I also incorporated the threat of total bodily annihilation."

Rick didn’t look up, his tongue poking from the corner of his mouth. “Unless you want to be molecular salsa, don’t interrupt. Some of us are busy getting us un-cancelled from existence.”

Morty warily edged toward Deadpool, clutching a burrito like a life preserver. “Hey, uh, Mister Pool? You really think we’re gonna make it back? Rick sounds, um, less confident than usual.”

Deadpool squatted, bringing his masked face down to Morty’s level. “Listen, kid. You ever watch a season finale and think, ‘Wow, they’re really just making this up as they go?’ Life’s basically that, but with more intestines.”

Morty blinked. “I don’t know if that makes me feel better or worse.”

“I aim for ambiguous!” Deadpool finger-gunned him.

A sudden, electric *crack* cut the air—green-blue sparks arced from the generator, crawling up the sides of the portal frame. Rick whooped, “All right, moment of truth! If this backfires, someone erase my browser history.”

“Get behind me, burrito boy,” Deadpool declared, scooping Morty and dragging him behind an overturned desk just as the generator’s hum crescendoed. The air warped, reality rippling like a wrinkled cartoon cel.

With a thunderclap, a new portal yawned open, flickering ominously—less “stargate” and more “eldritch screen saver.” The trio exchanged uneasy glances as the energies spilled more meta-chaos into the room, beckoning them toward whatever awaited beyond. 310 333 Chapter 9 - Scene 2} ch9_sc3:{9 3 Morty huddled behind the smoldering remnants of Rick’s latest failed experiment, wide-eyed as the machinery sparked and fizzed. “Uh, Rick, you sure you know what you’re doing? Last time you ‘improvised’ we almost fused with those Sentient Lint People.”

Rick waved a dismissive hand, not bothering to look up from the tangle of exposed circuits. “Relax, Morty. Worst case scenario, the entire multiverse implodes into an ironic singularity and we’re trapped in a cosmic punchline forever.” He belched, then jammed a glowing capacitor into the open chassis.

Deadpool paced in front of the workbench, spinning his katana absentmindedly. “Can I vote for that option? I’ve always wanted to meet the narrator. Think he wears pants?” He leaned over Rick’s shoulder. “And why all the drama, Doc Brown? Just hit F5 and reload reality.”

Rick glared. “The portal generator isn’t a desktop widget, Dipstick. Besides, our new… antagonist”—he spat the word out—“scrambled the meta-narrative pathways. Got it?” He triumphantly snapped the cover closed, the device humming with precarious energy.

Morty inched forward, voice shaking. “So, we just… turn it on and hope for the best?”

“Hope is for sitcom sidekicks,” Rick said, flicking a switch. The generator pulsed, projecting fractal light onto the scorched ceiling.

Deadpool whooped. “Oooh! Light show! Now, who wants to bet this thing spits us into a dimension made entirely of toilet paper?” He flicked the edge of the portal with his finger and pretended to shiver. “Or worse—Oscar bait movies.”

As the colors deepened and the portal’s spiral stabilized, a cold breeze swept over them. The smell of burnt cheese wafted through, oddly comforting amid the tension.

The three exchanged a look. Morty gulped. “Here goes nothing…”

Rick grinned, wild-eyed. “Strap in, boys.”

Deadpool saluted. “To the punchline, gentlemen!”

They plunged forward into the unknown—awkward, eager, and on the edge of reality itself. 307 333 Chapter 9 - Scene 3}] [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20] 18308 20000 {Breaking the Fourth Wall: A Multiversal Comedy of Errors When Deadpool accidentally stumbles into the multiverse, he collides—literally—with Rick and Mor...
