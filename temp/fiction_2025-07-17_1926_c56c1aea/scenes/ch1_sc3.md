Deadpool winked directly at what might as well have been a camera—there wasn’t one, but you never know with narrative these days. “Alright, boys, here’s how this is gonna work. You all shoot, miss spectacularly, and I get to be the star, okay?” He twirled both katanas overhead, the blades humming with anticipation. 

The mobsters exchanged uncertain glances, guns wavering. The biggest of them—neck tattoo of a butterfly, guts of a jellyfish—growled, “Just shoot ‘im!”

They unloaded in a clattering storm of lead. Deadpool leaped behind a toppled slot machine, bullets pinging off the chrome. “Watch the hardware! Rent’s murder!” He stuck one sword out, clipping the ankle of an advancing goon who twisted midair and landed face-first on a lunch buffet. “Complimentary shrimp, buddy!”

Deadpool vaulted over the slot machine, somersaulting feet-first into another mobster’s chest. The thug crumpled with an OOMPH, Deadpool landing nimbly beside him. “One down, five to go. Six if we’re counting my inner child, but he’s already dead inside.”

Another mobster lunged, swinging a pool cue. Deadpool ducked, the cue whistling overhead. He snapped off a quick counter: “This isn’t a billiards hall, Jimmy Two-Sticks.” Deadpool seized the cue, broke it over his knee, and jabbed the splintered end at his attacker’s belt buckle. The man squealed and backpedaled.

Somewhere, glass shattered. “I was just about to suggest a ceasefire and brunch!” Deadpool hollered, backflipping over spilled chafing dishes, blades carving lazy arcs, disarming one gunman and flicking his gun into a nearby planter. “This is why we can’t have nice things.”

He paused, breathless and grinning, amid the chaos. The rest of the thugs circled, faces paling. Deadpool flourished his swords. “So…who’s next? Don’t all volunteer at once!” 

And as the scene teetered on the edge of more mayhem, the lights flickered ominously overhead.
