Rick hauls himself up from a tangle of upside-down banisters, his lab coat smeared with spectral nacho cheese. “Morty, Deadpool—heads up! This M.C. Escher fever dream’s going recursive!” He flicks a glowing switch on his portal gun, sending static ripples through the impossible stairwells. Morty glances down as a stair beneath him melts into a slide, sending him hurtling past Deadpool.

“Whoa—oh jeez, oh jeez—” Morty tumbles, slamming into Deadpool, who barely budges. Instead, Deadpool throws out an arm to steady him.

“Relax, Morty. Worst case, we land in a Salvador Dalí clock factory and I finally get to prove I can punt a melting clock through a goalpost. Trust the process.”

A beat—then the villainous Meta-Master’s voice cackles from everywhere and nowhere. “You fools remain pawns. Your cozy banter only accelerates the punchline. Reality is a sketch, and I own the pen.”

Rick fires off a plasma shot up a twisting stair. “Yeah? Your pen writes like a sixth grader on TikTok. Keep monologuing—I’m triangulating your meta signature.”

Morty’s hands shake as he struggles to his feet. “Can meta-humor even hurt us? Or like… un-exist us?”

Deadpool spins a katana, grinning. “Meta-humor only hurts if you take yourself seriously. Lucky for us, you’re surrounded by experts in not giving a—”

The world hiccups. Suddenly, the floor becomes a panel of comic art, speech bubbles drifting through the air. Everything flickers between styles—watercolor, pixels, photorealistic. Rick yells, “Destabilization’s accelerating! If we don’t shut this down, we’ll end up as footnotes in a postmodern thesis!”

Deadpool leaps forward, sword raised. “First time for everything! Let’s break outta the margins, boys.”

As the trio barrels ahead, the staircases begin to collapse into whiteness, erasing behind their every step.
