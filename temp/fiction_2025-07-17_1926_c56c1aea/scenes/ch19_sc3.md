Deadpool crouches at the landing, twin katanas poised, peering down a stairwell that corkscrews in three impossible directions at once. The gallery’s architecture has gone full Escher, paintings of clowns winking knowingly from the warped walls. “I’m getting vertigo in places I didn’t know I had places,” he mutters, sheathing one blade to give a clown the finger.

Rick, unbothered by physics or basic decency, jerks a thumb toward the ceiling—or maybe the floor—where an exit flickers in and out of existence. “Standard meta-liminal geometry,” he grumbles, yanking a flask from his lab coat and swigging. “Just ignore causality and head for the light. Worst case, we end up in a Calvin and Hobbes reboot.”

Morty gulps, eyes flicking from Rick to Deadpool. “You guys act like this is normal. How is this normal? The stairs are arguing with each other!” He points as two steps physically part ways in a messy divorce, one reshaping into a spiral, the other sulking away as a ramp.

Deadpool gives Morty’s shoulder a squeeze. “Look, kid, reality’s more flexible than an Olympic gymnast. Step lively and just pretend the universe is rooting for you.” He winks—then promptly sinks halfway into the wall with a cartoonish “boing.”

Rick sighs, grabbing Deadpool by the arm and yanking him free with a wet pop. “Classic. You break the fourth wall so hard, even the infrastructure’s insecure,” he snarks, recalibrating his portal gun mid-leap onto a looping staircase. “Come on, trauma buddies—showtime’s that way.” He points, and a glowing neon exit sign flickers above a distant archway, spelling “META-NARRATIVE RESOLUTION.”

Morty chases after, tripping over his own feet and barely catching himself. “If we survive this, can we, like, never speak of it again?”

Deadpool grins. “No promises, kid. I live for the sequel.”  

They charge toward the exit, the stairs writhing beneath their feet, the laughter of unseen audiences echoing behind.
