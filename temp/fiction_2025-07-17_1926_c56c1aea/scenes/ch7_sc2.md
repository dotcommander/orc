Morty jerked back as a sentient “404 ERROR” sign buzzed past his head, cackling in a digital squeal. “Uh, Deadpool? Does it usually look like the world’s auditioning for a glitchcore TikTok?”

Deadpool twirled his katanas like an impatient baton twirler, half-waltzing through swirling polygons that phased in and out of existence. “Kid, in my line of work, this is like Monday brunch after tequila. Stick close, and remember: If the code starts flirting with you, just swipe left.”

Lights flickered across Morty’s face; the hallway rippled beneath his sneakers, floors rearranging—a staircase morphing into a slide then flattening into what appeared to be a carpet of animated memes. “Oh geez. Why is Shrek winking at me?”

Deadpool paused, puncturing a pop-up ad with his sword. Confetti and ‘SUBSCRIBE!’ buttons rained down. “Ignore Shrek. Focus! We’re looking for the Meta Mainframe. Vic says if you poke it hard enough, it coughs up plot devices like furballs.” He elbowed a floating search bar. “Hey, Google Maps? Give us the route to ‘Villains With Big Egos HQ.’”

The search bar snorted and zipped off. Morty’s voice wavered. “You’re sure Rick’s even in here? This place feels like an internet fever dream, man.”

“Trust me, kid. Nihilistic grandpas are like malware—always hiding in the source code. We just gotta keep breaking stuff ’til he crawls out.”

Suddenly, the corridor’s shimmering walls warped, pixelating into jagged comics panels. Word bubbles drifted like clouds: “WHAM!” “SNARK!” “RETCON!” A hollow laugh rolled down the tunnel.

Deadpool cocked an eyebrow at Morty. “Showtime, sidekick. Somebody’s using meta-humor as a laser grid maze. You ready to dodge punchlines?”

Morty gulped, clutching his portal gun. “As I’ll ever be.”

They stepped into the shifting maze, one foot in reality, the other skidding on satire—intent on not becoming the next joke themselves.
