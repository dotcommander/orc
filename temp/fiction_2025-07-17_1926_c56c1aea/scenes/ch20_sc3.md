Deadpool sways on his feet, the shifting realities rendering his red-and-black suit almost fractal. “Morty, buddy, try gagging in at least one dimension *away* from me. Unless you want a new nickname. Multiversal Puke Machine sound good?”

Morty’s face goes pale, but he manages a weary glare. “I don’t—ugh—do this on purpose, Deadpool. My existential nausea has layers.”

Rick, leading the trio up a staircase that stripes itself in checkerboard and static as dimensions flicker, snorts. “You two are amateurs. Back in my day, the multiverse tried to kill you by *boredom*, not sudden nausea. Keep up!”

He punches buttons on the remote device duct-taped to his portal gun. The hallway shivers, paintings of Schrödinger's cats meowing in sync and their eyes following as the group staggers past.

Deadpool glances around, making exaggerated jazz hands. “Just a nice stroll to save all reality, folks! Nothing crazy. Paintings coming to life, gravity doing the cha-cha, Morty inventing new phobias—Tuesdays, am I right?”

Morty grabs the rail. “Why does everything feel thinner? Like—like the universe is giving up?”

Rick’s voice gets soft, for once. “Because it is, Morty. Fourth wall’s practically powder. Laws of physics are suggestions at this point. But if we stick to the plan, maybe, just maybe…” He trails off, eyes flicking to Deadpool.

Deadpool gives Rick a crooked thumbs-up. “Hey, worst case, we explode heroically and traumatize the audience. Best case, we—uh—get our existential issues solved via group hug?”

Rick huffs, but doesn’t say no.

They reach a door at the landing, shimmering and inscribed with cartoon speech bubbles. Beyond it: the heart of meta-chaos. Deadpool claps his hands together, grinning wide.

“Alright, weirdos. Showtime.”

He kicks the door open.

Light and static pour out, swallowing them whole.
