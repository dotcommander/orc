Morty ducked behind a busted arcade cabinet as neon sparks spat from the gutted portal gun, pooling ozone in the ruined air. Rick hunched above the smoldering device, screwdriver between his teeth, muttering curses that alternated between quantum physics and complaints about Deadpool’s taste in chimichangas. The floor trembled—a subtle whump, then another, the rhythm oddly familiar.

Deadpool waltzed into view twirling a pair of katanas like batons, his mask singed at one edge. “Good news, gents! I got us a distraction. Bad news: I *am* the distraction.”

A chorus of staccato applause—really more of a slow, metallic clapping—echoed through the corridor. From the haze emerged the villain: The Stand-Up, their patchwork tuxedo and holographic bowtie flickering with static. Microphones orbited his head like malevolent moons.

“Oh great,” Rick groaned, jabbing a finger at Deadpool, “This is what happens when the multiverse’s least stable molecules try to play hero. We get *him.*”

The Stand-Up bowed with a flourish. “I thank you! And now—as they say in sitcoms—‘let’s get this show on the road.’” A microphone zipped from his orbit and pressed itself against Rick’s chest, emitting a harsh feedback squeal.

Morty, wide-eyed, risked a peek. “Uh, guys? I think he’s about to—”

A flood of one-liners burst from the mic, weaponized puns so bad reality itself winced. The floor buckled into punchlines: literal banana peels, anvils, a piano teetering overhead. Deadpool leapt forward, slicing an airborne rubber chicken in half.

“Finally!” Deadpool shouted, grinning. “A villain who respects the art of the callback!”

The Stand-Up cackled, firing off more reality-warping jokes. Rick yanked Morty back, shielding him from slapstick shrapnel. “If we don’t counter his shtick with our own, we’ll get erased—ironically!”

Deadpool cracked his knuckles. “Looks like it’s improv night, boys.”

The trio squared up as the room twisted—a stage set for chaos, and the show had just begun.
