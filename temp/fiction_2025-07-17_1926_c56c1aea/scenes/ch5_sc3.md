Deadpool’s boots dangled over the armrest. He twirled Rick’s disintegrator gun in his hands, marveling at the gaudy green LEDs. “So, is this set to ‘Swiss cheese’ or ‘existential crisis’? Because if it’s the second one, pretty sure Morty already beat you to it.”

Rick ignored him, frantically pawing through piles of gizmos and half-finished gadgets littering the living room. “Don’t touch that, pool noodle! If you trigger that thing inside the house, you’ll punch a hole in the space-time continuum and land us in a universe that runs on interpretive dance.”

Across the room, Morty peeked nervously from behind a stack of radioactive VHS tapes. “Uh, guys? Maybe we should…I dunno, make a plan?” He looked from his nihilist grandfather to the mercenary in red and seemed to reconsider suggesting any course of action.

“Plans are for people who can’t improvise,” Deadpool quipped, pointing finger guns at Morty. “But hey, you do you, kid. What’s the worst that could happen? Meta-villain erases us from all timelines and we end up in a Family Guy cutaway gag?”

Rick’s belch punctuated the air. “The only thing worse than that would be getting stuck in a CW crossover special. Morty, find the intermittently stable portal gun. Deadpool—put the disintegrator down before I turn your insides into taffy.”

Deadpool shrugged, tossing the gun with perfectly reckless aim. Rick snatched it mid-air, grumbling. “Cute. Next time I’ll recalibrate it to vaporize wisecracks.”

Morty started rifling frantically. Deadpool faced the fourth wall, voice dropping. “You ever notice how every crisis comes down to ‘find the widget, save the world’? Beginning to think my life’s getting written by a neural network with a thing for lampshading.”

Rick, unamused, muttered, “If you’re done with your Shakespeare in the Park, I could use an extra pair of hands over here.”

Deadpool slid off the couch, dramatic. “Fine. Cue the heist music. But if we end up in a montage again, I’m billing somebody.”

Morty found the portal gun. "Got it!"

They exchanged nervous, expectant looks—the calm before absurdity.
