Rick shrugs off the last of the portal static clinging to his lab coat, grumbling, “Alright, knuckleheads, we made it past the first knot of paradox—nobody here got existential whiplash, right? Wade, check your spleen.”

Deadpool looks down, pats his torso, then grins behind the mask. “Still squishy! But if you see me sprout another arm, let’s all pretend it’s a power-up.” He twirls his katanas for effect, the blades humming with unstable energy left over from their jaunt through meta-space.

Morty edges away from Deadpool’s swords, eyes fixed on the battered, comic-book style map Rick produced earlier. “So, uh, what’s next? The villain’s lair? Please tell me it’s not in a haunted amusement park or, like, inside a giant pie.”

Rick snaps his fingers. The holomap flickers, revealing shifting panels stacked like comic book frames. “No amusement parks, just an irony fortress at the center of the Multiversal Script Engine.” He leans in, voice dropping. “Villain’s going big time—he’s hijacking the narrative framework itself. Next stop, tropes made flesh. And not the cool ones.”

Deadpool sheathes his swords, steps closer to Morty, and says, “Buddy system! Safety in snark. You ever face sentient plot contrivances?”

Morty groans. “Do I look like I even know what that means?”

“Guys,” Deadpool stage-whispers, “the wall over there is… blinking at me.”

Rick cackles. “Yup, we’re close. When the fourth wall starts eyeing *us*, you know you’re headed for the boss level.” He slaps a gadget into Morty’s hand. “Interface it. Realities might unravel—so keep it together, will ya?”

Morty gulps, but his hand’s steady as he touches the device to the glowing wall, bracing himself for whatever’s next.

And the wall dissolves into fractal panels, revealing a corridor lined with laughing echoes of their own voices, beckoning them onward…
