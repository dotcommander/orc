Deadpool swings his katana in a lazy arc, watching as the impossible geometry of the staircases folds over itself like origami. His maskless eyes gleam through the red fabric. “Morty, buddy, if your knees feel inside-out, that means you’re *in* the right reality. Mine are basically Jell-O and unresolved trauma twenty-four-seven.”

Rick, footing precarious on a staircase that suddenly unravels into a Möbius strip, barks, “Less philosophizing, more moving! Meta-Humor’s signal is literally rewriting the architecture of this place—if we don’t get to the source, we’ll be Escher doodles before you can say ‘self-referential nightmare!’” He snaps open his portal gun, but it fizzles, emitting only a sad honk.

Morty whimpers as a banister twists into a question mark. “What if we get stuck here forever? I don’t wanna—like—be a punchline for some cosmic joke!” He grabs Deadpool’s sleeve as if the mercenary’s chaos might anchor him.

Deadpool gives Morty a sideways squeeze, surprisingly gentle. “Kid, the difference between a joke and a tragedy? Timing. And we’re *not* missing our cue. Rick, ideas?”

Rick’s eyes dart. “We need to trigger a narrative leap—something so out-of-genre it forces the story to stabilize. But it’ll have to be big.” He pulls out a flask, swigs, then belches a cloud of neon punctuation.

“How about a heartfelt musical number?” Deadpool suggests, jazz hands ready. “Nothing upends tone like jazz hands.”

Morty groans, but Rick grins. “Perfect. If irony’s the ammo, let’s overload the gun.”

Suddenly, an over-sized, spotlighted piano descends from above. Deadpool cracks his knuckles and smiles. “Break a leg, boys—but not on these stairs. OSHA’s gonna *hate* this place.”

Rick hops onto the bench, Deadpool on vocals, Morty reluctantly harmonizing. Their voices and chords echo, warbling against reality, as the stairs writhe in uncertainty—waiting for the punchline.
