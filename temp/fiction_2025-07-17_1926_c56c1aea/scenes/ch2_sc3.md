A bullet zipped past Deadpool’s head, shaving a chunk off the crate behind him. “Hey!” he yelled. “That was my good side!” With a flourish, he swung himself upright atop the wooden box, arms out in mock surrender. “All right, I get it, gangsters gotta gangster. But before someone ventilates my pancreas, can we chat about the economics of villain henchmanship? Seriously, unionize.”

The goons exchanged uncertain looks, their bravado wilting under Deadpool’s manic grin. One—maybe promoted by accident—stepped forward with a machine gun. “Shut up, freak, or we—”

He didn’t get further. With a blur of red and silver, Deadpool’s katanas pinned the man’s sleeves to the wall behind him. “Hands where I can see ’em—or… sleeves,” Deadpool chirped, landing beside a mountain of dubious-looking crates. “Now someone tell me which of these boxes has the weapon so dangerous the plot summary alluded to it, and I promise not to decorate the walls with your internal organs. Today.”

Another henchman, sweating through his suit, stammered, “We—we don’t know anything, man! Some scientist paid us to keep people out!”

Deadpool hopped down, landing boot-to-chest on the quivering man. “A scientist, huh? Let me guess: neckbeard, lab coat, social skills of a coding bootcamp dropout?”

A sudden flash above—portal blue, rimmed with electronic sparks—cut him off. Deadpool paused, katanas halfway through a crate lid. “Aw, c’mon, not again,” he whined, as a spaceship-shaped something clanged to the floor in a shower of fast food wrappers and empty booze bottles.

From the sticky heap, a small, nervous voice piped, “Uh, Rick? Where are we? And… who’s the guy in the red pajamas?”

Deadpool turned, grinning even wider. “Oh, great. More players have entered the game.”
