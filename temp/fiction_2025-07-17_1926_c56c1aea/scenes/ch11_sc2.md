Deadpool lounged atop an overturned crate, twirling one of Rick’s laser screwdrivers in his gloved hand. “Panicking? Please. I only do existential terror on Saturdays—and sometimes Wednesdays if I’m feeling spicy.” He winked at Morty, then accidentally pressed the screwdriver’s button. A beam shot out, vaporizing a mug shaped like Garfield’s head.

“Oh, come on!” Rick barked, snatching the tool back. “That was limited edition! You ruin one more thing and I’m building a Deadpool-magnet just to watch you struggle.”

Morty swallowed hard, glancing from Rick’s scowl to Deadpool’s wild grin. “But aren’t you, like…worried? This villain could, I dunno, erase us with a punchline or something.”

Deadpool hopped off the crate, capelet fluttering. “Nyeh! Look, sport,”—he jabbed a finger at Morty’s chest, but it ricocheted off Rick’s hastily extended forcefield, zapping Deadpool’s knuckle—“ow! Meta-humor’s my jam. Fourth wall, fifth wall, whatever. You gotta laugh in the face of annihilation, or else the annihilation laughs at you.”

Rick scoffed, fiddling with a jury-rigged quantum remote. “Yeah? Well, laughing’s not going to recalibrate the Multiversal Humor Regulator before the big bad turns us into yesterday’s running gag. Unless you wanna try slicing through unstable punchline particles.”

Deadpool mimed slicing with his katanas, sending imaginary chuckles slicing through the air. “See? Even my *pretend* skills are devastating.”

Morty slumped, running a hand through his hair. “What if this is all pointless? If stuff keeps getting more ridiculous, how do we even know what’s real?”

There was a pause—brief, uncomfortable.

Deadpool’s mask softened. “Kid, real’s whatever you’re willing to get blown up for. Or who.”

Rick cleared his throat, snapping a holo-screen to life. “Sappy time’s over. Our villain’s latest anomaly just pinged—three universes over.”

Morty’s eyes widened. Deadpool twirled a katana, grinning. “Field trip!”
