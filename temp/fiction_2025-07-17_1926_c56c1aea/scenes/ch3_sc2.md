Rick’s portal fizzed out behind them with a damp, fizzling pop, leaving Deadpool, Morty, and Rick momentarily surrounded by the eerie silence of the warehouse, shattered wood still raining down from Rick’s less-than-dignified entrance. Then the black-suited figures moved in formation, steps inhumanly synchronized. Their guns didn’t waver, and the name tags all read: “Generic Multiversal Henchman #...”

“Aw, c’mon, now that’s just lazy writing!” Deadpool shouted, gesturing at the swarm. One of the henchmen cocked his head.

“We’re cost-effective and ambiguous, sir,” the lead one droned in a voice like an over-caffeinated GPS.

Rick grunted, eyes never leaving the glint of their gun barrels. “Morty, remember—if bullets fly, duck behind your own existential dread.”

“Rick!” Morty hissed. “That’s not a thing you can—”

A hail of bullets erupted before Morty could finish. Rick flicked his portal gun at the floor, unleashing a lopsided bubble of green energy that splashed out to form a shimmering, makeshift shield. Bullets slapped against it with cartoonish *pwang!*s. Deadpool dove and rolled, katanas flashing, bisecting a henchman mid-run.

“Do you guys even have insurance?” Deadpool called out, kicking away a severed plastic gun.

The lead Generic Henchman’s tie fluttered. “Union says you’ll be paying for this, sir.”

Morty cowered behind a stack of broken crates as Rick peered around the shield. “Okay, plan: improvise.”

“Improvise is my middle name!” Deadpool whooped, leaping atop a crate. “Also, Francis, but that’s a long story. Who’s with me?”

Rick aimed his portal gun at the ceiling, thinking. “I’m issuing a distraction order: go nuts, Deadpool.”

Morty shot Rick a mortified look. “What about me?”

“You’re comic relief, buddy. Keep your head down.”

Deadpool grinned under his mask. “Best. Team-up. Ever.”

And with that, all hell broke loose.
