Morty stared at Deadpool, aghast, as the mercenary dangled the humming, sickly-green capacitor like a grotesque Christmas ornament. “Dude! That thing could, like, scramble your DNA or—”

“Morty, there are only two things in this universe that scramble my DNA: questionable taco trucks and bad writing.” Deadpool winked at the ceiling, as if the stage lights of a cosmic sitcom gleamed down on him. “And I’m still here, baby! Well. Meta-here, anyway.”

Rick snorted, fiddling with his portal gun. “Let him have his fun, Morty. If his molecules unspool, I’ll just fish out a slightly-less-damaged version from another universe. That’s the beauty of infinite mistakes.” He squinted, pulling up a holo-schematic of their nemesis’ lair. Neon grids shimmered, reflecting off his goggles and making him look, for a second, almost earnest.

Deadpool spun the capacitor on his finger. “So, Ricky Ticky Tavvi, what’s the play? Sneak in, boom, quip, save existence, roll credits?”

Rick adjusted the settings on the gun, jaw tense. “We portal in, hit the mainframe, stuff this capacitor into the reality engine before Happy Hour. But the villain—whatever the hell they are—already expects us.”

Morty chewed his lip, nerves jangling. “What if we—what if we try *talking* to them?” He offered, voice trembling but hopeful.

Deadpool froze mid-spin. “Wow, did you just suggest a feelings talk instead of an explosion? Is this Personal Growth? In *my* meta-comedy?”

Rick rolled his eyes, but there was something sharper, kinder in his glance at Morty. “Kid’s not wrong. The villain’s whole schtick is meta-humor. Maybe…breaking the cycle is the only way to win.”

A moment of uneasy silence hung between gun, capacitor, and portal. Deadpool grinned. “Fine. But if talking fails, dibs on first punch.”

Rick primed the portal, green spirals unfurling. “Let’s not keep meta-destiny waiting.”

They stepped through the crackling green doorway, into the unknown.
