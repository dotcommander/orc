Morty shuffles closer to Deadpool, casting anxious glances at the folding staircases. “Seriously, guys, are we sure this is the right layer of reality? Because my knees feel inside-out, and I’m pretty sure doors don’t usually have teeth.”

Rick’s portal gun beeps, projecting a hologram of branching timelines above his palm. “According to my readings,” he slurs, poking at the display, “we’re exactly one bad punchline away from nonexistence. Congratulations, idiots, you’re now statistically more unstable than my liver function.”

Deadpool twirls a katana with mock elegance. “Hello, metaphysical horror! I’d like to return your ambiance—preferably with a side of salsa.” He taps a grinning, chattering doorknob with his swordtip. It giggles, then bites. “Okay, NOPE, no handsies!”

A sudden tremor ripples through the walls. The architecture bubbles, stairs flow like syrup, and words appear—actual, floating words: LAUGH TRACK MALFUNCTION.

Rick groans. “Yup, the villain’s cranking the meta to eleven. If we don’t recalibrate the punchline stabilizer, we’ll be reduced to a running gag.”

Deadpool strikes a pose, katanas crossed. “Bring on the gags! I do my best work under comedic duress. Or any duress, really.”

Morty’s voice cracks: “Any chance we can—I dunno—skip to the part where we fix this, before the ceiling rewrites us into a knock-knock joke?”

Rick flicks a dial on the portal gun. Electric blue sparks bloom, distorting reality tighter around them. “Follow me, or don’t. Either way, I’m not letting some family-size packet of meta-humor turn us into concept art.”

The floor yawns beneath their feet, transforming into a conveyor belt lined with punchlines. With a collective yelp, the trio is whisked deeper, the sound of canned laughter echoing after them. 

Deadpool’s eyes shine behind the mask. “Hey, at least we’re getting a laugh out of it,” he quips, as the world slides into the next gag.
