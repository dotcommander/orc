Deadpool turned to Morty, feigning hurt. “Glowing glyphs are my whole aesthetic, Mort. It’s like telling Willy Wonka not to lick things.”

Morty crossed his arms, suspicion all over his face. “Look, I’ve seen enough of Rick’s labs to know you don’t mess with the glowy stuff. I mean, last week he melted half the garage with—wait, does that sigil look like it’s getting brighter?”

They both stared as the glyphs pulsed, radiating sickly chartreuse light. Behind them, Rick rummaged through a backpack brimming with dubious tech. “Hey geniuses!” he barked, not looking up. “If you’re done caressing the Doomswitch, can someone hand me the quantum disinhibitor?”

Deadpool squinted at the device Rick held—a tangled mess of wires and what looked suspiciously like an egg beater. “Is that safe to touch, or is this another Monty Python reference waiting to happen?”

Rick snorted, grabbing a gadget. “It’s only dangerous if you’re sober, which, thank god, I’m not.”

Suddenly, the glowing glyphs spiked, throwing frantic shadows on the walls. Morty yelped as the floor shivered beneath them—something deep and wrong building in the air.

“Ah, fudge!” Deadpool crowed, instinctively raising his katanas. “That’s never a good sign. Last time I saw lights that color, I woke up married to a Skrull.”

A fissure of shimmering energy split the air, and a voice boomed from nowhere and everywhere: “You dare tamper with the Meta-Nexus? Prepare for disconnection!” A sinister laugh echoed, pixels fluttering around the trio like dying butterflies.

Rick fumbled with the quantum disinhibitor, eyes wild. “Of course it’s the meta-police. Everybody shut up and do exactly as I say—and if you can’t, at least die funny!”

The room trembled. Deadpool grinned maniacally at Morty. “On the bright side, you can’t say your life’s not interesting,” he quipped, as reality buckled and the world twisted in on itself.
