The static crackled louder as Rick stepped forward, portal gun raised but uncharacteristically twitchy. "Okay, I don’t like this. Holomatrix reality is fluctuating—Morty, keep Deadpool from licking the walls."

Deadpool, hand mysteriously sticky, winked behind his mask. "No promises, grandpa. This much meta-energy is basically a free buffet for my trauma."

Morty sidestepped, glancing warily at a corridor that flickered between sitcom living room and dystopian wasteland. "I-I-I think we should stick together," he said, voice quivering. "Whatever’s controlling this place could, like, turn us into a running gag or just delete us—"

From a shifting mural overhead, a cartoon mouth sprouted and spoke. “Careful, boys! Everything you say can—and will—be used against you in the court of meta-narrative law!”

Deadpool cocked an imaginary gun with a click. “Ooo, I’d love my day in meta-court. Objection! My client—me—is too handsome for prison.”

Rick grunted, flicking his wrist to scan the surroundings. Holographic errors rippled around his device. "F***. We’re on a logic collapse countdown. Any more reality jokes and—well—"

The walls, offended by the banter, began dropping into panels of black-and-white comic strips, hiding exit doors with layers of punchline graffiti. A shadowy figure darted just out of sight, trailed by a ribbon of neon text: [INSERT PLOT TWIST HERE].

Deadpool leapt forward, blades flashing. “Time for that third-act confrontation! C’mon, Rick—Morty—you bring the nervous energy, I’ll bring the ultra-violence!”

Morty yelped as a flying pie shot past his head, spat out by a story-panel. “Why is everything trying to kill us with slapstick now?”

Rick grinned with sudden clarity, eyes glinting. “That’s it, Morty. Deadpool—their weapon’s comedy. Ours is chaos. Ready to flip the script?”

Deadpool’s mask stretched in a grin. “I was born ready. Literally. My monologue started at birth.”

In that moment, the villain’s laughter echoed—beckoning them deeper into the multiversal labyrinth.
