Morty watched in alarm as Deadpool vaulted up onto the cracked countertop, red boots squelching in something that might once have been orange juice. “All right, multiverse breakfast meeting!” Deadpool declared, arms spread wide. “Rule one: ricochets are encouraged. Rule two: whoever says ‘what could possibly go wrong’ gets a surprise wedgie.” He swung his swords for emphasis, narrowly missing a plastic dinosaur.

Rick, slumped against the fridge with a beer can instantly manifesting in his hand, belched. “I’m not collecting infinity stones with a cosplaying nutcase who narrates his own inner monologue, just saying.”  
“Aw, c’mon, Rick! He’s—uh—we might need his, like, expertise in…chaos?” Morty squeaked, eyes flicking between the two.

Deadpool landed beside Morty, close enough for Morty to smell gunpowder…and maybe tacos? “Morty gets it! That’s why he’s the fan-favorite.” Deadpool gave Morty a light punch on the arm. “We’ll come up with a plan. Preferably one with more explosions than last time.”

Rick rolled his eyes and eyed a broken portal gun part on the table. “Plan number one: Find whoever—or whatever—merged our realities before the multiverse does that thing where it folds in on itself and turns all known matter into hot pockets.”  
“Did someone say Hot Pockets?” Deadpool’s head snapped around, hopeful.

Morty cleared his throat, trying to sound braver than he felt. “R-right, so, step one: figure out who’s messing with the fabric of reality. Step two: don’t die. Step three: do we even have a step three?”

“Step three,” Rick muttered, “is don’t listen to Deadpool’s step two.”

Deadpool grinned. “Spoil my fun, why don’t you. But I agree with Rick for once—let’s raid the garage for gadgets. Or at least matching jumpsuits.”

Rick scoffed, but Morty, with Deadpool at his side, found himself smiling despite the rubble and the chaos. For the first time, this team-up almost sounded…kind of fun.
