Deadpool shakes his head, trying to clear the inside-out feeling that lingers from traveling through the metaphysical guts of the multiverse. “Speak for yourself, Doc Brown. My spleen’s in French and my brain is still buffering. And yet—” He slaps the side of his head theatrically. “Nothing! Why do I pay for premium?”

Morty, wobbling on his feet, glares at Deadpool like he might be contagious. “We almost, like, vaporized, man. What if there’s time ghosts stuck to us now?”

Rick fishes a battered flask out of his coat. “Relax, Morty, worst you’ll get is a mild case of narrative vertigo. Or a new phobia. Either way, something for your therapist.” He unscrews the flask and takes a swig, then offers it to Deadpool, who accepts it with a grateful flourish.

“Y’know, I expected interdimensional travel to be more… interdimensional. You know? Where’s all the lightning and gravitas? I feel like we skipped six months of gritty character development.”

Morty checks his own hands as if they might turn into spaghetti. “Rick, are we really safe here? That villain—Meta-Lord or whatever—he can still find us, right?”

From the gloom, Rick flicks a switch and the chamber floods with blinking lights, screens unfurling like digital scrolls around them. “Safe is relative, Morty. Here in my crossroads cache, reality’s got enough guardrails; Meta-Lord won’t sniff us for at least—” he glances at a watch physically labeled ‘Plot Device’—“ten minutes, unless he gets a writer’s note.”

Deadpool holds up the flask and grins. “So that’s how long we have to plan the villain’s existential comeuppance, or at least make some truly questionable decisions before the meta-maw unhinges and eats us?”

Rick smirks, his eyes reflecting screens full of impossibly branching realities. “Let’s not waste time, then.”

A flicker of something—hope, fear, or maybe just static—passes through Morty. The trio circles the console, facing the next impossible step together.
