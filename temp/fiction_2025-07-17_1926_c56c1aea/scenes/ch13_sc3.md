Morty hovered by the workbench, pacing in tight little circles while Rick jammed the reclaimed flux capacitor into the half-disassembled portal gun. The garage was a chaos storm of sparking wires, empty chimichanga wrappers, and the heavy thump of Deadpool’s boots as he bounced in place, impatient as ever.

“So, we just… slap it in and hope for the best?” Deadpool asked, hands on katanas, voice muffled by his mask but still somehow *smirking*.

“I’d say it’s more of a precision science job,” Rick grunted, fiddling with a soldering iron that pulsed with unnatural blue energy. “But sure, Wade, let’s just slap some supercharged multiversal flux in here and cross our… whatever passes for fingers in your healing-factor-horror-show anatomy.”

Morty wrung his hands. “I-I just don’t wanna get turned inside out, okay? Remember the Spaghetti Universe?” He shuddered, focusing on the scorch mark on the wall from their last misfire.

Deadpool sidled up to Morty, pressing a cold, gloved hand against his shoulder. “If you get spaghetti’d, kid, I’ll make sure to pour one out for you. Not like a literal beer, that’d be unsanitary. Maybe a nice marinara?”

“Aaand, done!” Rick barked, flipping a switch on the retrofitted gun. The entire garage hummed with possibility—electric, tense, dangerous. A green spiral flickered inside the portal emitter, erratic and sizzling.

Morty stepped back. “Is it… stable?”

“Stable’s a strong word,” Rick muttered, eyeing the device as if it might explode (it might). “Deadpool, you’re up. If the gun implodes, at least it’ll be entertaining.”

Deadpool seized the gun with gleeful bravado. “If I don’t make it, remember me as the beautiful deviant I was.” He aimed at the wall. A heartbeat’s pause.

Rick and Morty held their breath.

Deadpool squeezed the trigger—

With a crackle and a shriek, a new portal tore open, colors rippling, beckoning them forward.
