Morty’s hesitation lasted exactly as long as it took for Deadpool to leap over a console and snatch the capacitor from his hand. “Hazmat suit? Pfft. Morty, I’ve eaten chimichangas that were more radioactive than this thing.”

Blue static danced across Deadpool’s gloves; for a heartbeat, he went cross-eyed, watching cartoonish sparks snap at his fingertips. “Ooh. Tingly. Is this supposed to happen, Doc Brown?”

Rick turned, eyeing Deadpool with a scowl so deep it should have had its own gravitational field. “Give it here, dipstick. And don’t drop it, unless you want to see what your intestines look like in five dimensions.” With impressive sleight of hand (and a belch), Rick snatched the device back and began fiddling with its settings.

Morty, who had wisely retreated behind a support pillar, peeked out with bug-eyed suspicion. “I don’t know, guys. The villain’s, like, weaponizing meta-humor. Shouldn’t we—uh, I dunno—use irony-resistant gloves or something?”

Deadpool grinned. “Morty, if I was scared of meta-humor, I’d have never survived my own comic run.” An explosion somewhere above sent dust drifting down. Red warning lights started to pulse in corners none of them had noticed before.

“Man, this place is about to go full Michael Bay,” Deadpool quipped. “Rick, you done playing with your cosmo-Tamagotchi?”

Rick didn’t look up. “Stall the goons. Five more seconds.”

Morty gulped as footsteps thundered down a corridor. Through shattered glass, a squad of surreal, meme-faced henchmen advanced, their faces flickering between Shrek, Doge, and Big Chungus. One pointed at Deadpool and boomed, “Much wow. Very dead.”

Deadpool raised his katanas, voice stagey. “Gentlemen, welcome to the roast—hope you brought punchlines.”

As Rick hunched over the capacitor, Morty grabbed a wrench, adrenaline finally overtaking his anxiety. The meta-humor army surged, and the trio readied themselves, the line between threat and absurdity blurring with every step.
