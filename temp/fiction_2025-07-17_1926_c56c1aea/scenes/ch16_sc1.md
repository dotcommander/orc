Deadpool’s mask crinkled in mock concern as he paced around the center of the shattered arcade. “So, if I press this button,” he said, one gloved hand hovering over a console’s battered control panel, “will it save the universe, or turn us all into Funko Pops?” He looked over his shoulder at Morty, who was furiously trying to reroute meta-energy with duct tape and a half-melted joystick. 

“Don’t—d-don’t even joke about that!” Morty stammered, sweat beading along his brow. “I do *not* want to live the rest of my existence with giant soulless eyes, dude!”

Rick, meanwhile, had sprawled out across a prize counter, legs flopped over a stack of dusty Tetris cartridges. He rummaged for any salvageable tech parts, his voice a droll monotone: “Just hit the red button, Wade. Worst-case scenario, we get rebooted for a grittier streaming platform.”

Deadpool grinned behind his mask, flipping the sword in his hand like a drumstick. “That’s the spirit! Who’s ready for a reckoning with the laws of comedy and reality simultaneously?” He stabbed the air twice for emphasis, then—against everyone’s better judgment—slammed his palm onto the oversized button.

A pulse of meta-energy burst from the console, tearing across the room in neon fractals. The walls melted into TV static, then snapped back, flickering between settings: a sitcom living room, a noir alley, a pixelated dungeon. Morty yelped as a couch materialized under him, launching him into the air.

“Whoa—okay! That’s—never doing that again!” Morty scrambled for footing as gravity returned.

Rick adjusted his portal gun. “Reality’s shredded. Nice going, Deadpool. But hey, at least the laugh track’s working again.”

Indeed, canned audience laughter echoed, inexplicably, from the ceiling.

Deadpool dusted off his hands theatrically. “If we die, I’m asking for a refund. But if we live… dibs on the sitcom spinoff.”

A jagged hole of pure meta-energy pulsed open in the arcade floor. They exchanged glances—time to jump or be swept away.
