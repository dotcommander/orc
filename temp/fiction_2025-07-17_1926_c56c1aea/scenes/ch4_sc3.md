Morty blinked twice, as if recalibrating to find Deadpool holding court in the Smith kitchen. Rick, head deep in the fridge, muttered, “This is why breakfast vodka needs to be stronger.” Summer, still in pajamas, just rolled her eyes and poured cereal. 

Deadpool scanned the audience. “I’ll be your host, MC, and potential new stepdad if your mom plays her cards right!” He winked at nobody in particular, brandishing the spatula. “Can I get a round of applause for reality’s flimsiest barriers?” He gestured broadly, causing milk to slosh dangerously close to the edge of Morty’s bowl.

Morty edged away. “Uh, is he always like this?” he whispered to Summer.

“Apparently, it gets worse,” Summer sighed.

Rick re-emerged, clutching a suspiciously glowing bottle. “Wade, if you’re gonna wreck my house, at least be useful. You know how to make eggs on six simultaneous temporal vectors?” 

Deadpool curtsied. “For you, Rick, I’ll scramble space-time for breakfast.” He threw three eggs into the air, expertly snatching the first two midair and ignoring the third as it splattered onto Jerry’s shirt—Jerry, who had just walked in and immediately retreated, muttering something about ‘weird dreams.’

Ignoring the mess, Deadpool cracked his fictitious knuckles. “Now, as part of your morning orientation: Evil just broke the fourth wall. Reality’s got plot holes, continuity errors, and maybe a few angry fanfics leaking in. Sound familiar?” 

Rick squinted. “You’re saying someone’s weaponized meta-humor?”

Deadpool nodded sagely, spatula on heart. “And we need to out-meta the meta, or kaput—no more reruns or spinoffs for anybody.”

Morty bit his lip. “So, we save the multiverse?”

“Save it, maybe autograph it, definitely get tacos after,” Deadpool replied.

Summer tossed her hair. “All this before coffee. Rad.”

As Deadpool leapt from the counter, pointing his spatula toward cosmic adventure, Rick grinned, the first spark of professional curiosity kindling in his eyes. The unlikely team’s breakfast had just become their first war council.
