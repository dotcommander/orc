Morty stood in the doorway, clutching a cereal box to his chest like a pathetic shield. “So, uh, you’re really Deadpool? Not like some weird shapeshifter or—oh god—Cronenberg thing?”

Deadpool didn’t miss a beat, dramatically bowing over the kitchen island. “Only the real deal, kid. Still waiting on someone to roll out the red carpet and a commemorative mug, though!” He flapped a gloved hand towards Summer, who rolled her eyes from behind her phone.

Rick slammed the fridge shut, brandishing a carton of something suspiciously unlabeled. “If I cared, which—spoiler alert—I don’t, I’d ask how you even got in here. But dimension-hopping randos showing up is basically Tuesday now.” He poured the ‘milk’—questionable viscosity—into his mug instead of the cereal bowl, then topped it off with clear vodka from his coat.

Deadpool sidled up to him, exaggeratedly sniffing the concoction. “Breakfast cocktail? Mind if I—” He reached for the mug; Rick zapped his hand with a little blue device.

“Touch my science juice and the only fourth wall you’ll be breaking is your own femur, jackass.”

Morty cautiously set his cereal on the counter, glancing between his grandpa and the costumed assassin. “Wait, so, does this mean like, our universe is in danger? Or are you just here to—uh—do a guest spot or something?”

Deadpool cocked a finger gun at him. “Both! But word of advice, Mort: if a mustache-twirling jackass in a plot-hole cape shows up? Run.”

Summer briefly looked up. “Just promise not to trash the house before cheer practice, okay?”

Rick grumbled, “Too late; existential dread’s already leaking under the doors.”

Deadpool perched on a chair, swinging his legs. “Alright, team! Next step: totally normal strategy meeting. Or pancake breakfast. Whichever requires fewer existential police chases.”

The family exchanged looks. It was going to be a very long morning.
