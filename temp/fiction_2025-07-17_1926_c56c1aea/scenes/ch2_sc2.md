Deadpool popped up from behind the crates like a gory Jack-in-the-box, twin katanas flashing in neon warehouse light. “Wow, you guys ever consider NOT shooting at the guy in red?” he chirped, ducking as another volley of bullets chewed through cardboard and splintered wood.

From the catwalk above, a burly thug in a ski mask bellowed, “Get him! Boss wants him alive!”

Deadpool rolled his eyes so hard it hurt. “Alive? Pfft, boring. You sure he doesn’t want, like, one chunk to put on his mantel?” He launched himself forward in an acrobatic whirl, slicing a pistol in half midair. The owner stared at what remained of his weapon, confusion written as clearly as the ketchup stains on Deadpool’s suit.

“Sorry, warranty probably doesn’t cover that,” Deadpool quipped, backflipping over a spilled crate of rubber chickens. They bounced everywhere, raising the surreal stakes.

A thug lunged. Deadpool kicked a chicken into his face. “FOWL play!” he crowed, then skewered another henchman’s sleeve to a wall. “Stick around! Oh—wrong franchise, sorry.”

Something crackled in Deadpool’s earpiece—static, then a voice weirdly reminiscent of a certain mad scientist. “Hey, jackass in red—move your ass to Bay 4. Now.”

Deadpool’s eyes widened inside the mask. “Unprompted advice from the great cosmic beyond? Or is my therapist finally returning my calls?” He leapt behind a forklift as heavy gunfire stitched lines across the concrete.

The warehouse shuddered, lights flickering. “Weird. That’s not foreshadowing at all,” Deadpool muttered. He peered over the forklift to see the last henchman drop his weapon and run.

Deadpool shrugged, then tiptoed toward Bay 4—because ignoring mysterious voices never did anybody any good. “Onward, to whatever lazy plot device awaits!” he called, vanishing around the corner as rubber chickens continued to bounce in his wake.
