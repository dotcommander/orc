Rick’s left eye spasmed as currents of azure static spiderwebbed across the flickering walls. Morty cringed behind him, clutching the leftover taco Deadpool had conjured up from somewhere unspeakable. The oppressive buzz of the collapsing holomatrix reality began to strain through their teeth.

Deadpool, for his part, was hopping between the busted neon tiles like some anarchic game of hopscotch. “Guys, you ever get that tingling sensation? Y’know, like your atoms might turn into nacho cheese at any moment? Because—woo!—I think I’m dripping.”

Rick gritted his teeth, adjusting a slider on the portal gun. “If your atoms cheese out, at least you’ll taste better than your one-liners.”

Morty shot Rick a pleading look. “Grandpa, can you fix this before we all end up as, uh, existential fondue?”

Before Rick could retort, a new fissure ripped across the ceiling. From the ragged gap, cartoonish word bubbles tumbled down—‘BOOM!’, ‘LOL!’, and ‘???’. They spun around Deadpool’s head in dizzying orbit.

Deadpool, undeterred, snatched a bubble midair. “‘LOL’? C’mon, even my inner monologue is phoning it in.” He squished the bubble; it popped with a wet raspberry.

“Okay, that settles it. Reality’s going full meta meltdown,” Rick muttered. He surveyed the crackling air, then fired up the portal gun—and nothing happened. The device spasmed in his hand, coughing up a plume of glitter and a faint laugh track.

“Aw jeez…,” Morty whimpered, shrinking closer to Deadpool out of reflex.

The static swelled. Reality yawned wide. For a fractured heart-pounding instant, all three found themselves staring past the veil—at outlines of panels, rows of script notes, and even the glint of a cosmic editor’s red pen.

Then, just as quickly, the fissure snapped shut. The word bubbles fizzled out. Everything seemed to freeze, breathless. Deadpool grinned, unruffled. “Anyone else feel like we just got rebooted?”

Rick’s glare could’ve burned through the multiverse. “No more jokes. We’re outta time.”
