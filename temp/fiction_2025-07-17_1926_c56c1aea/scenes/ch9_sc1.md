The laboratory reeked of ozone and taco grease. Deadpool kicked an errant test tube toward a quivering portal generator in the center of the chaos. “So, Rick, you ever think about inventing a ‘Make All This Not-Happen’ gun, or do you just wing it with science and a surly attitude?”

Rick flicked the back of his hand, slinging a splatter of blue fluid onto a console. “Morty, tape the trans-dimensional relay. Deadpool, keep your trigger finger off anything that glows. Every wavelength of reality is about to get seared through a punchline-shaped loophole.”

Morty fumbled for the duct tape, nervously glancing at the sparking machinery. “Uh, Grandpa Rick, is that… normal?” A ripple of static arced from one device to the taco Deadpool had stashed in Morty’s grip, causing it to pulse neon pink.

“Tacos aren’t supposed to do that, right?” Deadpool poked it, half-hopeful, half-horrified. “If this thing eats my hand, I want royalties.”

Rick ignored him, wrenching wires and muttering, “Fourth-wall destabilization—a quantum comedy cascade. We’re at ground zero for a meta meltdown. If we don’t–”

Suddenly, the lights flickered. The portal generator groaned, coughing up a jagged rift. Through it, a shadowy figure smirked—a vaguely familiar silhouette, ringed in cartoon speech bubbles that spun like razor blades.

“Oh great,” Deadpool muttered. “A gag villain.”

The villain’s voice boomed, layered and glitched, as if dubbed by thirteen sarcastic narrators at once. “You thought the joke was on me. But I am the joke. I am the chaos behind the punchline!”

Rick threw a glance at Deadpool. “Is it too late to return you to the factory with a recall notice?”

Morty yelped as the taco in his hands began reciting knock-knock jokes in a demonic voice. All three braced themselves as the villain stepped forward, the edges of the fourth wall crumbling behind them, reality bending with each word.
