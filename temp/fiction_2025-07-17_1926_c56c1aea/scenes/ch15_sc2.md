Morty’s knuckles whitened around a scorched joystick as Deadpool, half-sitting atop the cracked pinball machine, surveyed the carnage like a bored king. Shimmering, unstable currents of meta-energy crackled from the fractured portal gun’s exposed core, arcing dangerously close to Rick’s gray-streaked hair.

“Hey, science Santa, maybe don’t cook us with existential lightning?” Deadpool twirled a broken paddle. “I’m already crispy from the outside in.”

Rick spat out the screwdriver. “You want to fix this, dipshit, be my guest,” he grumbled, soldering iron alight. “Or go quip somewhere else before the quantum punchline lands on your head.”

Morty, wide-eyed, peeked from his cover. “Is—is that normal? It’s glowing brighter.”

“Nothing’s normal, Morty,” Deadpool said, eyes flickering to the spreading web of energy above them, their reality rippling like cheap green-screen effects. “But you? You’re doing a great job holding up that perfectly defenseless cabinet.”

Rick’s hands worked furiously, sweat beading on his brow. “We’re about to get smacked with a recursive meta-collapse. If the joke eats itself, we all blink out. Permanently.”

Deadpool leaned forward, voice dropping. “Wait, like actual dead dead? Not comic book dead?”

Rick didn’t look up. “Dead dead. Non-existent. Even the part of you that thinks you’re in on the gag.”

For a beat, the humor thinned, leaving only the humming portal core and the three of them—halos of fear and stubbornness, shadows dancing in garish arcade light.

“Okay, okay, you need help?” Morty gulped, inching forward.

Rick nodded once, tersely.

Deadpool hopped down, tossing the pinball at the rippling energy, which ate it with a pop. “Time to get hands-on, boys. Just don’t let the multiverse see us sweat.”

A new surge from the device scattered coins and glass across the floor. Together, their silhouettes gathered around the ailing portal gun—improvised heroes in the neon ruin—preparing, wordlessly, to take on oblivion.
