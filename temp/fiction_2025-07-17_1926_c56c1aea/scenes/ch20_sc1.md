Deadpool inches down the warped staircase, his boots tapping three different materials: marble, shag carpet, and suspiciously sticky linoleum. He glances back—Rick shuffles behind him, ray gun ready, and Morty clings to the handrail like a terrified squirrel.

“Is it just me,” Deadpool whispers, “or does this place smell like comic book glue and broken dreams?”

Rick snorts. “That’s the scent of narrative entropy, dipstick. Means we’re close to the meta-core. Or Morty wet himself. Statistically, both.”

“Real funny, Grandpa,” Morty grumbles, tightening his grip. The walls around them flicker, scenes from their own pasts blurring in the wallpaper—Deadpool fighting in grayscale gutter space, Rick and Morty’s silhouettes running from yet another existential disaster.

A gash suddenly opens midair. From within, the villain—Dr. Panopticon—emerges, his cloak a storm of TV static and meme faces. “Ah, my favorite punchlines—arrived right on cue,” he purrs, voice layered like a sarcastic laugh track.

Deadpool spins his katanas. “Finally, somebody uglier than my last editor. And less likely to give me notes!”

Rick raises his ray gun. “Let’s skip the witty repartee, Four-Eyes. Too much meta-humor and the universe’s guts’ll blow out.”

Panopticon grins, stretching like a GIF. “That’s the idea, Sanchez. Without structure, all your little worlds will dissolve into punchlines with no setups. I’ll be the only joke that lasts.” His shadow spreads, slapping self-aware labels onto the steps: “Chekhov’s Gun Here,” “Foreshadowing Zone,” “Insert Flashback.”

“Uh, guys, I really don’t wanna fall through a plot hole,” Morty squeaks.

Deadpool winks. “That’s the spirit, kid! Nobody likes cliffhangers—unless they’re literal.” He leaps, swords out, aiming to sever the villain’s shimmering shadow. Rick flips a switch and blue light crackles. Panopticon only laughs, the stairwell shivering under his power—until everything jolts with a cinematic cut, and blackness swallows the scene.
