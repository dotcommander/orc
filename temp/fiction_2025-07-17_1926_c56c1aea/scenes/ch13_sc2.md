Deadpool twirled the capacitor on one finger, grinning beneath his mask. “Relax, Morty. Worst case, I wake up with three extra nipples. That’s hardly a character arc.”

Rick snatched the part out of Deadpool’s hand with a snarl, clamping it carefully onto his workbench. “You idiots almost vaporized us into an ironic footnote. This isn’t a toy, it’s the only thing keeping the meta-fabric from collapsing. Jesus, I can taste the fourth wall fraying.” He flicked his tongue experimentally. “Tastes like burnt popcorn and cancelled sitcoms.”

Morty shuffled back, hugging his arms. “Can we just… focus, please? That—thing—Meta-Monger, or whatever, it’s still out there. And it keeps showing up exactly where it’ll hurt the most.”

“Yeah, almost like someone’s writing them into every terrible situation. Oh wait, that’s literally what’s happening,” Deadpool chimed, waving at an unseen camera. “Hi, readers! Still with us? Don’t you have laundry to fold?”

Rick groaned, digging circuitry from a pile of junk. “I swear, if you break the narrative structure even more, I’ll staple your mouth shut with quantum flux wire.” A pause, then: “Actually, Morty, hand me that neuro-resonator. Left of the Pickle Rick figurine.”

Morty dug through the clutter, retrieving the device—a dented helmet festooned with blinking lights. “What’s this even supposed to do?”

Rick affixed it to his brow, wires dangling. “If I can amplify the narrative signal, we might be able to track Meta-Monger’s next punchline. Assuming Deadpool didn’t fry every probability node with his little juggling act.”

Deadpool perched on the edge of the table, kicking his heels. “Relax, doc. If narrative physics gets weird, we’ll just improvise. Fourth wall punchlines are kinda my thing.”

A low hum filled the garage as Rick’s devices powered up, casting odd specters on the walls. For a moment, all three stared into the uncertain glow, anxiety and bravado holding tight in the flickering light.
