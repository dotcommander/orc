Morty lurches upright, clutching the portal gun like a child drags a tattered teddy bear at bedtime. “Rick, how do we tell which stairs go up and which ones go sideways?!” His shoelaces have been tied together by an impossible logic loop—they knot and unknot themselves as he walks.

Deadpool, popping into existence halfway up a floating bannister, dangles by one hand and waves the other. “Guys! These stairs remind me of my mental health. Complicated, weirdly twisted, and you always end up back where you started, except with more bruises!”

Somewhere above, the walls flicker, the villain’s graffiti-style laughter echoing: “HA! UPPER STORY, GET IT?” Reality whorls like someone’s jiggling a cosmic Etch-a-Sketch.

Rick reloads his portal gun with a belch. “Meta-humor’s destabilizing the physics. If we keep playing along, we’ll get rebooted into sock puppets. Or worse, a gritty reboot!”

Morty’s eyes widen. “Rick, my legs are going sideways. My knees aren’t supposed to bend like this!”

Deadpool lands with a gelatinous thunk. “Relax, buddy, just break the fourth wall—oh wait, we already did that. Maybe try the fifth? Or the floor; I hear it’s actually cake.”

He grabs Morty’s hand, pulling him onto a step that looks safe, though it fizzles with punchlines. For a moment, the three stand together, united by confusion and stubborn hope.

The villain’s distorted voice booms overhead: “Don’t you three nerds get it? Punchlines power the multiverse now. The only way out is the biggest joke.”

Rick narrows his eyes, almost impressed. “Alright, team: time to get seriously unserious. If laughter’s the weapon, we out-joke the joke.”

Deadpool tips an imaginary hat. “Finally, a plan I can live with. Or die with. Or live, then die, then live again with. Let’s make ‘em laugh till the universe wheezes.”

Morty gulps. “No pressure.” The trio square their shoulders, stepping forward—into the epicenter of absurdity.
