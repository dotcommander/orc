Morty’s sneakers squeaked as he scrambled away from the disassembled portal gun, hands shielding his head. “Uh, Rick? Should there be *that* much smoke?”

Rick barely glanced up, fingers flying over the exposed circuitry. “Relax, Morty, smoke is just science’s way of—”  
A pop! The lab bench lurched. Purple sparks fizzled, raining over Deadpool’s katanas littered alongside a pizza box.  

“—letting you know you’re doing it right,” Rick finished, then coughed. “Hand me the quantum widget. No, not the glowy one. The other glowy one.”

Morty shuffled forward, eyes watering. Deadpool, mask rolled halfway up, snacked on congealed pizza. “Should someone maybe, I dunno, call a fire department?” he asked, mouth full, waving a slice at the chaos.

Rick snatched the part Morty shakily offered. “Morty, you ever notice how every dimension’s version of you still panics the exact same way?” He jammed the widget into the gun. “And you!” He pointed at Deadpool. “If you’re gonna snack, make it useful. Pepperoni’s packed with—”

Before Rick could finish, the portal gun thrummed. Circuits stitched themselves together in a pulsing purple glow. “Ha! Still got it,” Rick smirked, just as a sudden, pixelated distortion rippled through the room.

The walls flickered—actual comic panel edges slicing the lab in sharp relief. Word balloons drooped from the ceiling. Deadpool gave a low whistle. “Whoa. Feels like we tripped into a software update. You guys seeing this?”

On the ceiling, bold text sputtered: “CHARACTERS EXPERIENCE SEVERE META-OVERLOAD.”

Morty gulped. “Uh, should our reality be—*reading itself*?”

A distant, glitchy chuckle echoed, weirdly familiar—laced with static.

Rick paled. “That’s… not good,” he muttered. The portal gun in his hand warped, turning partially two-dimensional. They collectively edged backward, the fourth wall melting, unreality leaking through.  

Deadpool glanced at the reader. “Don’t touch that dial, folks.”
