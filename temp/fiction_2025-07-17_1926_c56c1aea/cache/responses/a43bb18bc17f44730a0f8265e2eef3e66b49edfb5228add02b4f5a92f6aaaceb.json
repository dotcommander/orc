{"response":"**Chapter 4 Planning**\n\n---\n\n**1. Chapter Purpose (Plot Advancement):**  \nChapter 4 establishes the reluctant alliance between Deadpool, Rick, and Morty, as they make their first multiversal jump in pursuit of The Meme Weaver. This chapter’s core is comic friction: Deadpool's chaos grinds against Rick's arrogance and Morty's anxiety, but necessity forces them to cooperate. Their first interdimensional foray shows the stakes (surreal world warping, their own unstable personas backfiring) and relentless threat of The Meme Weaver, setting up the need to outgrow their self-defenses to stand a chance. The chapter also drops hints about the villain’s motives and the danger of ultimate meta-collapse.\n\n---\n\n**2. Chapter Title:**  \n**“Crossed Wires and Derailed Realities”**\n\n---\n\n**3. Three Scenes with Specific Objectives and Word Targets:**\n\n---\n\n**Scene 1 (approx. 333 words):**  \n*Objective:* Deadpool tries (badly) to ingratiate himself to Rick and Morty. Amidst the aftermath of the portal crash, Rick and Deadpool butt heads, laying out their conflicting approaches, while Morty panics about collateral damage and the arrival of The Meme Weaver’s first glitch into their garage. Their forced truce forms as the villain hacks reality for the first time.\n\n*Scene Focus Points:*  \n- Debris, portal residue, and Deadpool’s ridiculous self-introduction.  \n- Rick’s furious science-y rant; his early analysis of Deadpool’s “fictionality”.  \n- The first tangible corruption: a meme-glitched household item or person.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 2 (approx. 333 words):**  \n*Objective:* First jump: The trio chase a trace of The Meme Weaver into a parody dimension (e.g., a ‘Simpsons’-like Springfield)—and confront warped versions of themselves. The environment is saturated with parody and memes. Each character’s defenses betray them; they resort to slapstick combat and failed meta-jokes. By the end, they glimpse how the villain is feeding on their self-aware schticks.\n\n*Scene Focus Points:*  \n- Arrival and quick adjustment to bizarre parody world rules.  \n- Each of the trio faces/gets mocked by a doppelganger.  \n- The Meme Weaver’s influence is felt and taunts delivered; consequences mount.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 3 (approx. 334 words):**  \n*Objective:* Fleeing the collapsing parody universe, the trio regroup. Rick and Deadpool trade wounds—physical and emotional. Morty tries to mediate and is unexpectedly helpful. The goal is to reveal (through bickering and a failed plan) that unless they actually work together—and drop their ironic personas—they’re doomed. The scene ends with The Meme Weaver hijacking Rick’s portal gun, raising the stakes, and sending them tumbling to the next universe.\n\n*Scene Focus Points:*  \n- Chaotic escape; Rick’s pride vs Deadpool’s mockery.  \n- Morty’s small breakthrough (shows empathy or insight).  \n- The Meme Weaver’s escalation—portal gun sabotage, reality further destabilized.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Scene | Focus                                                         | Objective                                                 | Words |\n|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n|  1    | Aftermath chaos, forced alliance, first glitch in the garage  | Set the trio’s dynamic and truce; introduce villain threat|  333  |\n|  2    | Parody dimension entry, doppelgangers, meme surrealism        | Test/undermine characters’ personas; reveal villain’s method |  333  |\n|  3    | Bickering escape, teamwork lesson, villain escalates          | Force deeper cooperation; raise stakes with portal theft  |  334  |","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:27:21.097934-04:00"}
