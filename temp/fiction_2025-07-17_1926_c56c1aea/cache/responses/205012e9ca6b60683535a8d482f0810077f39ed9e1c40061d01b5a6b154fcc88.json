{"response":"Morty balanced nervously on Rick’s cluttered workbench, avoiding an ominous beaker that pulsed with suspicious purple light. “So, uh, Deadpool, how come you’re not panicking? Forty percent is, like, way worse than the odds I usually survive our adventures.”\n\nDeadpool swung his legs, examining the portal gun’s innards with childlike wonder. “Kid, I’m made of unstable molecules and bad decisions. I don’t do panic—I outsource it to everyone else in the room.” He shot Rick a finger-gun. “Boom! See? Delegation.”\n\nRick snorted, fingers dancing over soldered wires. “If you cared about odds, you wouldn’t wear red for camouflage.” His eyes darted to the portal device’s flickering core. “Now hand me that quantum stabilizer—no, not the one shaped like Garfield cosplaying as a toaster. The blue one.”\n\nDeadpool rummaged through Rick’s toolbox with deliberately exaggerated incompetence. “Ah, yes, the classic blue doodad. Here ya go!” He brandished a rubber chicken.\n\n“Are you… are you screwing with us right now?” Morty whined, wringing his hands. “If we don’t get this fixed, the meta-collapse will eat everything! I mean, even the theme song could get erased!”\n\nDeadpool paused, all snark evaporating for an instant. In the hum of the garage, he met Morty’s worried gaze. “For what it’s worth, kid, I got screwed-up coping, not a death wish. If it comes down to it, I’ll make sure you get to the end credits.”\n\nRick’s hands hesitated, but he didn’t look up. “Touching. Now, Deadpool—try not to break reality while touching reality, okay?” He yanked the blue stabilizer free from Deadpool’s grip, slapped it onto the portal gun, and sparks flew.\n\n“Buckle up, kids,” Deadpool crowed. “Whatever’s next, it won’t be boring.”\n\nThe device whined, lights cycling toward the red—then blinding white. The air tasted of static. Reality itself began to ripple at the edges.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:34:43.99136-04:00"}
