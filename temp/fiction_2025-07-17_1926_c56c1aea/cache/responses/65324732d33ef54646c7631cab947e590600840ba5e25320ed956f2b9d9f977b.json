{"response":"Morty shuffled awkwardly near the remains of a vending machine, nervously watching Rick fiddle with what looked like a blender, six portal guns, and maybe someone’s prosthetic leg. Sparks spat from the contraption. “Uh, Rick? You sure you know what you’re doing?” His voice sounded small in the cavernous interdimensional hub, echoing off graffiti-stained walls.\n\nDeadpool leapt off the crate, landing with a wobbly flourish. He tossed the screwdriver aside, missed the workbench entirely, and shrugged. “Don’t worry, Morty. He probably has the scientific, uh, ‘je ne sais malarkey’ required for quantum whatchamacallit stuff. Me? I’m just hoping whatever he’s building explodes in glorious Michael Bay fashion.”\n\nRick snorted, not bothering to look up. “It’s a recursive meta-lepton destabilizer, Deadpool. If it explodes, we’re all becoming punchlines in a subreddit nobody reads.” He glanced at Morty, who looked on the verge of chewing his own sleeve. “Zip it, Morty. Hand me the gelatinous flux capacitor.”\n\nMorty rummaged through the pile of vaguely menacing gadgets and extracted a quivering, neon cube. “It’s sticky. Why is it sticky?”\n\n“Science, Morty. And probably Deadpool.”\n\nDeadpool grinned under his mask. “Everything I touch gets sticky, pal. Occupational hazard. Also, I had nothing to do with the severed hand in that corner. Let’s move on.”\n\nRick snatched the cube, jamming it into the growing device. It fizzed ominously. “Connection established,” he muttered. “One more phase and maybe—just maybe—we can track that punchline-thief across realities.”\n\nFrom somewhere above, distant thunder rumbled—the kind that signaled either an oncoming narrative twist or a hole ripped in space-time. All three tensed in mutual, grudging anticipation, the air buzzing with the kind of tension you can only get when the fate of infinite universes hangs in the balance…and your only backup is a traumatized teenager and a sociopathic mercenary with a kink for chaos.\n\nRick wiped sweat from his brow. “Here goes nothing.” He slammed the final switch.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:34:57.258339-04:00"}
