{"response":"Morty slapped Deadpool’s hand away from the suspiciously blinking button. “Dude! Didn’t Rick literally say not to touch anything with glowing glyphs on it?”\n\nDeadpool scoffed, eyeing Morty with feigned injury. “Are you implying I can’t resist the siren call of clearly dangerous, irresistible buttons? That’s on-brand for me, kid.”\n\nRick, hunched over a surging tangle of neon wires, didn’t look up. “If our realities flatline because you two played Whack-a-Multiverse, I’m not replacing *either* of you with alternate versions. Too exhausting.”\n\nDeadpool strolled over to a cracked pinball machine, poking the glass. “Alternate versions? Is there, like, a Deadpool somewhere who reads instruction manuals instead of improvising with high explosives?”\n\n“Statistically, yes,” Rick muttered, rummaging through a pile of blinking circuit boards. “But he’s a huge disappointment at parties.”\n\nSuddenly, an erratic whine rattled the walls. The arcade’s fluorescent tubes flickered—a spiraling hole tore open above the skee-ball lanes, spraying pixels and fragments of comic strip speech bubbles.\n\nMorty’s voice trembled. “Uh… What *is* that?”\n\nRick swore quietly. “A narrative rift. Our villain’s getting creative with reality-editing. Right on schedule.”\n\nAs a word balloon floated by—lettering morphing between “KABOOM!” and “WHOOPS!”—Deadpool whipped out his katanas, slicing it in half midair. “Can’t they pick a punchline and stick to it?”\n\nRick snorted, pulling Morty behind a toppled arcade cabinet. “If we’re going to stabilize the plot, I’ll need thirty seconds to hijack the mainframe. Try not to escalate things.”\n\nDeadpool grinned wolfishly, squaring up to the mawling rift in the ceiling as stray cartoon limbs wriggled out. “Copy that. I’ll be the comedic relief *and* the front line.”\n\nHe planted himself between the chaos and his teammates, twin blades gleaming, as reality itself cackled ominously—and the odds of making it out in one sane piece shrank by the second.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:36:52.289816-04:00"}
