{"response":"Deadpool rolls his shoulders, glancing around at their bizarre new surroundings: a swirling Escher-esque corridor where staircases overlap and impossible doorways hover in midair. Every few seconds, the walls flicker with snatches of comic book panels and cartoon backgrounds—someone’s greatest hits collage, with the punchlines all jumbled.  \n\n“New Rule,” Rick groans, patting his coat for a fresh flask (and finding a banana, two grenades, and, with a shrug, the flask). “We don’t do that kind of travel again unless reality itself is on fire.”  \n\nMorty peers at a floating window showing a version of himself with enormous biceps fighting a taco. “Uh, is it supposed to be doing that?”  \n\n“Morty, don’t make eye contact with the alternate buff version. It’s bad for your self-esteem,” Deadpool quips, reaching out to prod one of the warped comic panels. Instead of resistance, his hand sinks right through, accompanied by a satisfying *boing-oing* sound effect and a cloud of animated birds.  \n\n“Okay, this is just getting more meta by the minute,” Deadpool says, pulling back his arm—now awkwardly shaded in cel animation. “Does anyone else smell imaginary ink?”  \n\nRick squints down a corridor, then suddenly drops his flask. “That’s not just good meta: look.”  \n\nAt the far end, a shadowy figure emerges through a rippling speech bubble—every word trailing from its mouth becomes a semi-solid piece of reality, like floating text boxes weaponized.  \n\nMorty gulps. “Is that… THE VILLAIN?”  \n\n“As advertised.” Rick’s voice is grim. “Whoever that is, they’ve already bent the narrative physics. We’re walking into their punchline now.”  \n\nDeadpool draws his katanas, spinning them with a flourish. “Fine by me. I never liked punchlines I didn’t write.”  \n\nHe gestures for Morty and Rick to fall in; together, they step toward the heart of the impossible corridor, ready—or not—for the next joke to turn lethal.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:37:21.89556-04:00"}
