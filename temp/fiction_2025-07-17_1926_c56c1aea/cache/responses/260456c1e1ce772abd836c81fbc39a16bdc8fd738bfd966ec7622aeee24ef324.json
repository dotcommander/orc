{"response":"Morty huddled behind the smoldering remnants of Rick’s latest failed experiment, wide-eyed as the machinery sparked and fizzed. “Uh, Rick, you sure you know what you’re doing? Last time you ‘improvised’ we almost fused with those Sentient Lint People.”\n\nRick waved a dismissive hand, not bothering to look up from the tangle of exposed circuits. “Relax, Morty. Worst case scenario, the entire multiverse implodes into an ironic singularity and we’re trapped in a cosmic punchline forever.” He belched, then jammed a glowing capacitor into the open chassis.\n\nDeadpool paced in front of the workbench, spinning his katana absentmindedly. “Can I vote for that option? I’ve always wanted to meet the narrator. Think he wears pants?” He leaned over Rick’s shoulder. “And why all the drama, Doc Brown? Just hit F5 and reload reality.”\n\nRick glared. “The portal generator isn’t a desktop widget, Dipstick. Besides, our new… antagonist”—he spat the word out—“scrambled the meta-narrative pathways. Got it?” He triumphantly snapped the cover closed, the device humming with precarious energy.\n\nMorty inched forward, voice shaking. “So, we just… turn it on and hope for the best?”\n\n“Hope is for sitcom sidekicks,” Rick said, flicking a switch. The generator pulsed, projecting fractal light onto the scorched ceiling.\n\nDeadpool whooped. “Oooh! Light show! Now, who wants to bet this thing spits us into a dimension made entirely of toilet paper?” He flicked the edge of the portal with his finger and pretended to shiver. “Or worse—Oscar bait movies.”\n\nAs the colors deepened and the portal’s spiral stabilized, a cold breeze swept over them. The smell of burnt cheese wafted through, oddly comforting amid the tension.\n\nThe three exchanged a look. Morty gulped. “Here goes nothing…”\n\nRick grinned, wild-eyed. “Strap in, boys.”\n\nDeadpool saluted. “To the punchline, gentlemen!”\n\nThey plunged forward into the unknown—awkward, eager, and on the edge of reality itself.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:34:06.660871-04:00"}
