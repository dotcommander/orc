{"response":"Shimmering, unstable currents of meta-energy traced outlines in the scuffed arcade carpet, flickering through half-destroyed consoles. Deadpool polished a nonexistent speck on his sword hilt, voice too casual. “Well! That was… educational. Rick, buddy, next time you point your portal gun at a self-referential anomaly, could you *not* aim it at my crotch?”\n\nRick, arms buried to the elbows inside the sparking guts of a Street Fighter cabinet, grumbled without looking up. “I said hold still. Quantum feedback doesn’t discriminate between plot device and plot *armor*.” He yanked out a glowing circuit board. The severed data lines spat out code in actual Comic Sans, writhing into jokes about the author. “Great. We’re down to one continuity and a fistful of punchlines.”\n\nMorty, still gripping the ruined joystick, squeaked, “Are… are the reality stitches supposed to *hum* like that? Also, my fingers are numb.” Above them, the rip in the fourth wall pulsed and distorted, revealing flashes of audience faces—some bored, some laughing, all impossibly, unreachably *real*.\n\nDeadpool hopped down. “Look alive, fellas. Or at least don’t die in a boring way. This villain’s whole schtick is draining universes dry, one wink at the camera at a time.” He eyed the rip as it spasmed, spit out a half-finished sitcom laugh track, and then sucked it back up.\n\nRick tossed Morty the circuit board. “Hold this. Don’t let it insult your intelligence. Deadpool, get ready—we’re going on offense. We’re down to meta-brass tacks here. If we can disrupt the punchline stream, maybe we buy the multiverse a few more panels. Or at least get a decent exit cue.”\n\nDeadpool raised his swords. “Nothing makes me happier than existential improv—except maybe tacos, or mocking narrative structure itself. Let’s give ’em a show.” He winked, not sure if at the others or the audience.\n\nSomewhere, the fourth wall trembled—waiting.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:36:34.650748-04:00"}
