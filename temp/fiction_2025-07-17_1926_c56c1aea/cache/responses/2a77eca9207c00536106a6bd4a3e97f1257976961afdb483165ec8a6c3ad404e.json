{"response":"Deadpool flopped onto Rick’s battered couch as if auditioning for a mattress commercial—if the mattress was lumpy, smelled faintly of pickle brine, and had definitely witnessed war crimes. He propped his boots on the cluttered coffee table, scattering a constellation of nuts, bolts, and what was probably a sentient toaster crumb. His mask twisted into a playful grin.\n\n“I mean, look at me! Accept no substitutions, kiddo,” Deadpool crowed, finger-gunning Morty with comic-book panache. “No lizard man, no body horror. Just Canada’s finest unstable export.” He plucked the cereal box from Morty’s grip and squinted at the label, grimacing. “These are gross. Is everything in this dimension…sad?”\n\nMorty stammered, “Uh, depends. Are you gonna start shooting? Because the last time Rick brought home a weird guy in red spandex—”\n\n“Morty! Stop being a little drama-sponge and get me the laser wrench!” Rick barked, emerging from the kitchen with a flask and a live, mildly offended rat dangling from his other hand. “Deadpool, ignore him. Or don’t. I literally don’t care.”\n\nDeadpool, now upside-down on the couch like an enthusiastic gymnast, called, “Hey, Rick! Did your portal gun always make that weird coughing noise, or is it allergies season for fictional technology?”\n\nRick slumped beside him, joint popping like bubble wrap. “It’s your fault my gun’s coughing up multiversal hairballs. Meta-humor pollution, jackass.” The rat scurried free, dropping a tiny monocle as it fled.\n\nMorty hesitated, then pressed the laser wrench into Rick’s outstretched palm. “So… what’s the plan? There is a plan, right?”\n\nDeadpool spread his arms wide, inviting chaos. “The plan is: we wing it and pray the author isn’t off their meds.” He winked at the ceiling. “I’m looking at you, text monkey!”\n\nRick slugged his flask, rattled the portal gun, and managed a smirk. “Let’s break something. Maybe fate itself.”\n\nThe couch creaked under the weight of mischief.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:32:17.587244-04:00"}
