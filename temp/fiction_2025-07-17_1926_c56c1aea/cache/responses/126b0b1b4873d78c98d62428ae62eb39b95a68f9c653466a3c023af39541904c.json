{"response":"Morty’s sneakers squeaked as he scrambled away from the disassembled portal gun, hands shielding his head. “Uh, Rick? Should there be *that* much smoke?”\n\nRick barely glanced up, fingers flying over the exposed circuitry. “Relax, Morty, smoke is just science’s way of—”  \nA pop! The lab bench lurched. Purple sparks fizzled, raining over Deadpool’s katanas littered alongside a pizza box.  \n\n“—letting you know you’re doing it right,” Rick finished, then coughed. “Hand me the quantum widget. No, not the glowy one. The other glowy one.”\n\nMorty shuffled forward, eyes watering. Deadpool, mask rolled halfway up, snacked on congealed pizza. “Should someone maybe, I dunno, call a fire department?” he asked, mouth full, waving a slice at the chaos.\n\nRick snatched the part Morty shakily offered. “Morty, you ever notice how every dimension’s version of you still panics the exact same way?” He jammed the widget into the gun. “And you!” He pointed at Deadpool. “If you’re gonna snack, make it useful.
