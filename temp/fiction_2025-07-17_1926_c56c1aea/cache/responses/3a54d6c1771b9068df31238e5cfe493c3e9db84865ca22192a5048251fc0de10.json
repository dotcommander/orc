{"response":"**Chapter 11 Planning**\n\n---\n\n**1. Chapter Purpose:**  \nThis chapter marks the turning point where Deadpool, Rick, and Morty, after much bickering and bluster, are forced to confront The Meme Weaver directly. For the first time, their typical defenses utterly fail them—Rick’s scientific cynicism, Deadpool’s meta-humor, and Morty’s anxious sarcasm are all weaponized against them. This chapter advances the plot by heightening the personal stakes: our heroes must face the cost of their emotional masks as the multiverse dissolves into unruly nonsense, pushing them toward vulnerability in order to fight back.\n\n---\n\n**2.
