{"response":"Deadpool peeked over the splintered crate, katanas glinting behind him, surveying the warehouse’s new arrivals. Black-suited figures fanned out with guns drawn, each one with the same “Generic Multiversal Goons Local 399” logo on their sleeves. Deadpool couldn’t help himself.\n\n“Wow, custom jackets? You guys unionized already? Color me—uh, bulletproof vest,” he quipped, hopping from his perch and rolling behind a stack of barrels as another hail of bullets sparked off the floor.\n\nOne goon shouted, “Cut the chatter and hand over the dimensional doohickey!”\n\nDeadpool’s mask crinkled where his brow would be. “Dimensional doohickey?” He patted his pockets, producing: a rubber chicken, a half-eaten chimichanga, and—oops—a blinking device shaped suspiciously like a Rubik’s cube melted in a toaster. “You mean this?”\n\n“She’s got the plot device!” another goon hollered, instantly prompting all weapons to train on him. Deadpool shrugged, tossing the device into the air and catching it behind his head like someone who both cared too little and too much.\n\n“Let’s dance, boys,” he quipped, flinging a barrel into their path. Gunfire erupted; Deadpool zigzagged through it, leaping atop a fallen shelf, dual pistols blazing. Spent cartridges rained down in a glimmering arc.\n\nOne goon lunged. Deadpool tripped him with a sweeping kick, then ducked as a second swung a baton. “Ooh, melee combat! I rate this two out of five stars for effort.”\n\nSuddenly, a bottle green portal fizzled open midair with the sound of a slurping straw. Out tumbled Rick—drunk, burping, and aiming a portal gun at Deadpool’s head. Behind him, Morty skidded to a stop, wide-eyed.\n\nRick looked around, unperturbed by the chaos. “Aw jeez, who invited Red Power Ranger?” he sneered.\n\nDeadpool grinned. “Costume party, old man. You bringing punch or just the body odor?”\n\nThe warehouse crackled with tension—a standoff, primed to explode.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:31:21.13553-04:00"}
