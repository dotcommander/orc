{"response":"Deadpool pauses, twin katanas idly resting on his shoulders as he surveys the ever-shifting architecture with a theatrical sigh. “All right, MC Escher wants his nightmares back.”\n\nMorty shuffles close behind, eyes saucer-wide. “W-where are we now? Guys, this place feels like the inside of a math problem—one I definitely can’t solve!”\n\nRick burps, staggering forward as if the floor is moving—which it very well might be. “We’re in the Meta-Maze, Morty. Multiversal defense mechanism. Only place more convoluted than a comic book crossover.”\n\nA stairway folds in on itself just as Deadpool jumps, flipping midair and landing sideways on a wall that is suddenly the floor. He grins, waving at Morty and Rick, who are now standing at a right angle to him. “I always wanted to moonwalk up a paradox. C’mon, it’s fun!” He moonwalks, finger guns blazing.\n\nMorty follows tentatively, gravity bending with each step. “Gramps, do you see that?” He points to a looping corridor, where frames flicker like the pages of a comic book being thumbed too fast. Inside, distorted images of themselves argue in infinite panels.\n\nRick snorts, fiddling with a rewired portal gun. “That’s just the maze mocking our existence, Morty. Or possibly referencing the last time I blacked out inside a Grant Morrison fever dream.”\n\nSuddenly, a booming laugh echoes. The walls ripple, the staircases rearrange, and a voice—simultaneously familiar and impossible—fills the air. “Welcome, travelers! Ready to get lost in your own punchlines? Or would you rather face the heart of the joke?”\n\nDeadpool spins, swords raised. “Ha! Been lost for years, pal! Now where’s the punch(but not the)line?”\n\nRick glances at Deadpool, then Morty. “Stay close. If this maze is truly meta, our only way out is through.”\n\nAll three steel themselves, and together, they step forward as the corridor shivers, the laughter growing louder.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:37:30.213702-04:00"}
