{"response":"When Deadpool accidentally stumbles into the multiverse, he collides—literally—with Rick and Morty, unleashing chaos that threatens to erase all their realities. Forced to team up to stop a villain who’s weaponized meta-humor itself, the trio must confront their own coping mechanisms (be it violence, nihilism, or sarcasm) and discover whether true connection is possible when nothing feels real. The story is a wild, irreverent ride that explores the cost of constantly hiding behind jokes, challenging each character to find purpose—even when the fourth wall is in ruins.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:26:16.63097-04:00"}
