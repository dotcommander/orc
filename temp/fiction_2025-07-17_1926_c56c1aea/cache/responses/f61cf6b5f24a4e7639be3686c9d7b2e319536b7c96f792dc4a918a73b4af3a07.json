{"response":"Certainly! For Chapter 8, let’s anchor the narrative as the momentum truly accelerates: our trio plunges into increasingly weird multiverses, facing warped reflections of themselves and each other—while The Meme Weaver’s grip tightens.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Chapter Purpose**\n**Advance the plot by forcing Deadpool, Rick, and Morty to confront perverse versions of themselves in bizarre alternate realities (engineered by The Meme Weaver), exposing their key flaws. This deepens their emotional arcs, tests their alliance, and heightens the threat by showing The Meme Weaver’s accelerating corruption.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Chapter Title**\n**Chapter 8: “Meme Streets of Multiverse”**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Three Scenes with Objectives and Word Targets**\n\n---\n\n#### **Scene 1: Portal Problems \u0026 Parody People** (~333 words)\n**Objective:**  \nPlunge our trio into a chaotic parody universe, where they face outrageous versions of themselves. Deadpool fights an ultra-wholesome “Heroic Deadpool;” Rick faces a “Positive Rick;” Morty deals with a hyper-confident “Chad Morty.”  \n**Purpose:**  \nSurface their insecurities and set up the sense of escalating meta-chaos—demonstrate The Meme Weaver’s influence and the risks of losing their core selves.\n\n---\n\n#### **Scene 2: Scratch the Surface, Shatter the Walls** (~333 words)\n**Objective:**  \nThe trio is forced into a bizarre meta-landscape where their inner thoughts and snarky personas manifest as literal entities—“Nihilist Rick,” “Insecure Morty,” and “Cartoon-Addict Deadpool.” They’re attacked by their own worst tendencies, glitched into reality by The Meme Weaver.  \n**Purpose:**  \nPush the characters to recognize how their defenses are holding them back from working together—heighten tension and personal stakes. Start hinting that authenticity, not meta-irony, might be the key.\n\n---\n\n#### **Scene 3: Tick-Tock—Reality Rot** (~334 words)\n**Objective:**  \nAs their surroundings decay into meme-fueled absurdity (duck-taped timelines, running gag-physics, etc.), the trio catches a direct glimpse of The Meme Weaver—seeing the villain warp entire universes with a joke. They barely escape, Rick piecing together that only a “genuine” connection can disrupt the villain’s power.  \n**Purpose:**  \nRaise the stakes—showing reality itself is nearly lost. Crystalize the clue for the climax: they’ll need to drop their personas for real, not just as a joke, to survive.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Scene | Focus / Objective | Word Target |\n|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| 1. Portal Problems \u0026 Parody People | Face faulty doubles; expose flaws | ~333 |\n| 2. Scratch the Surface, Shatter the Walls | Fight manifested inner personas; force self-awareness | ~333 |\n| 3.
