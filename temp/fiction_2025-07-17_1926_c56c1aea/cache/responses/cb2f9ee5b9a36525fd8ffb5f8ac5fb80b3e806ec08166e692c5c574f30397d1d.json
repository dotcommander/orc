{"response":"Rick grunted, flicking greasy hair from his eyes as he hunched over the portal device. He gave Deadpool a withering look. “Yeah, yeah, Spandex McMouth—there’s only a forty percent chance it explodes in our faces this time. I call that progress.”\n\nMorty hovered nervously behind them, clutching the Szechuan sauce like it was an ancient relic. He eyed the sparking wires. “Uhh, Rick, what if it, like, erases our molecules or something?”\n\nRick smirked, soldering iron spitting tiny blue sparks. “Then you’ll finally stop whining about algebra.”\n\nDeadpool tilted his masked head, hands theatrically on his hips. “Hey, if we’re getting vaporized, I’d like a little warning. I got socks at home that need matching.” He peered over Rick’s shoulder, eyes catching a glowing button. “Ooo, what’s this do?”\n\nRick slapped his hand away. “That’s the discombobulator. Touch it again and you’ll be twelve-dimensional spaghetti.”\n\nMorty gulped, shrinking back. “Can you guys, like… not fight for five seconds? The meta-humor anomaly’s getting bigger—look!” He pointed to the monitor, where a psychedelic crack spider-webbed outward, flickering with snippets of alternate realities—a sitcom backdrop, a noir cityscape, even a silent black-and-white frame where they all wore Groucho glasses.\n\nDeadpool sighed, softer than usual. “Okay. Okay, Science Grandpa. Let’s juice this baby up before our punchlines start rewriting gravity.”\n\nRick’s hands flew over the device, fingers nimble despite their tremor. “Best line you’ve had all day, Poolboy. Morty, brace for—”\n\nThe portal device whined, lights surging as the crack yawned wider. A blast of wind whipped around them, carrying laughter, canned applause, and the faint scent of burnt chimichangas. Deadpool grinned behind his mask, feeling adrenaline and dread in equal measure.\n\nRick slammed a button. The portal roared open, and all three stared into the blinding, kaleidoscopic unknown.\n\n“Showtime,” Deadpool whispered.\n\nThe wind sucked them forward—and the world fractured into nonsense light.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:34:37.223252-04:00"}
