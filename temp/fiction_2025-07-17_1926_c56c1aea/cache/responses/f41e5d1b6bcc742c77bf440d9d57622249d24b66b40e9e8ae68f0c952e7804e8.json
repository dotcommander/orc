{"response":"Deadpool zipped behind a stack of conveniently placed shipping crates, red suit barely a smear. Bullets sang through the air, pinging off metal and ricocheting into improbable locales—was that a takeout menu? “Nice grouping! You guys ever consider joining the Harlem Globetrotters?” he yelled, firing off a few rounds that missed spectacularly but looked gorgeous in slow-mo.\n\n“I don’t think the Globetrotters use guns, dude!” hollered a thug, cradling an Uzi with the careful affection of someone who’d definitely not pass a background check.\n\nDeadpool dove, rolling to his feet with exaggerated grace—if you could call colliding with a crate “grace.” He peered around, eyes narrowing behind his mask. “Let’s see… three goons left. One’s behind ‘Box of Chekhov’s Guns,’ one’s semi-conscious, and one guy’s realizing life insurance was a scam.” He cracked his knuckles, then his neck, then, for flavor, a glow stick. “Party time!”\n\nHe lunged. The first goon swung a pipe, missing Deadpool by a solid foot. Deadpool responded with a twirl worthy of a Broadway musical, smacking the thug upside the head with the butt of his own pistol. “And that’s what we call improvisational theater!” the merc crowed.\n\nGunman number two tried to get a bead, but tripped on the aforementioned takeout menu—now revealed to be extra greasy. He went down in a flurry of curses and lo mein. Deadpool didn’t even break stride as he stomped past, pausing only to lift a fortune cookie. “Your future holds… severe brain trauma. Ouch.”\n\nThe last goon, sweating bullets, aimed wildly. Deadpool sauntered up, unflappable. “Ever seen ‘The Matrix’?” he asked. The goon blinked, confused—then Deadpool disarmed him with a flourish and a wink to the imaginary audience.\n\n“Dodge this,” Deadpool whispered, finger gun leveled—then flicked the goon’s forehead. The thug crumpled, one final laugh track echoing in Deadpool’s imagination as he strode toward the next corridor.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:30:58.555411-04:00"}
