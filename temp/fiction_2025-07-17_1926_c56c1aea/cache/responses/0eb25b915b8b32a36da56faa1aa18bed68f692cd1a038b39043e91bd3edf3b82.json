{"response":"Morty watched Deadpool with a mix of awe and unease as the merc twirled the gun dangerously close to his own face. “Uh, Deadpool? Maybe don’t point that at your—” Morty’s voice faltered as Deadpool cheered, pressing something at random. A green laser shot out and sliced a chunk off the faux-Velvet Elvis painting behind them.\n\nRick jerked up from under the console, half-buried in tangle of wires. “Hey! Watch it, Pool Boy! That’s genuine interdimensional kitsch!”\n\nDeadpool shrugged, tossing the gun from one hand to the other. “Relax, gramps. These fingers are insured. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? The universe explodes and we all get rebooted with slightly worse casting?”\n\nMorty cringed. “Please don’t give the universe ideas.”\n\nRick snatched the gun from Deadpool, eyeing him up and down. “You break my stuff again, and I’ll stick your regenerative nose where the sun don’t shine, capisce?” He jammed the gun into a holster, then flicked a switch on the dashboard. The lights in the room flickered, and a portal hummed to life in the corner.\n\nDeadpool spun dramatically to face the swirling green vortex. “At last! Adventure! Angst! Vitamin D!” He made a running leap—\n\n—and tripped over an empty flask, colliding headfirst into the snack shelf. Bags of Portal Pringles cascaded over him.\n\nMorty burst out laughing in spite of himself. “Dude! Are you, like, indestructible everywhere except your dignity?”\n\nDeadpool, sprawled and buried under chips, gave Morty a thumbs up. “It regenerates faster than you think.”\n\nRick rolled his eyes, stepping over Deadpool’s legs to grab a portal remote. “All right, idiots. Everybody ready? Next stop: meta-horror mode. Try not to break anything. Again.”\n\nDeadpool stood, brushing fake cheese dust from his suit. “No promises, grandpa.”\n\nWith that, they stepped toward the portal, the flickering green light swallowing them as the room dissolved behind.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:32:34.293952-04:00"}
