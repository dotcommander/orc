{"response":"Deadpool eyed the portal device cradled in Rick’s trembling hands like a time bomb made of duct tape and bad decisions. “C’mon, Doc Brown, you sure you wired it right? Last time you tried this, I ended up with my head on a spider’s body, and not the fun Halloween kind.” \n\nRick, sweat beading above his browline, sneered. “That’s because you touched the ickium converter, dumbass. Now stop flapping your gums and hand me the quantum spanner!” He jerked his head toward the workbench, where a dubious metal object glowed radioactive green. \n\nDeadpool, grinning beneath the mask, made jazz hands. “You got it, boss.

The portal shrieked, sending out a shockwave that rippled the lab like a bad TV edit. The meme-faces grinned wider. \n\nMorty yelped, “Is this supposed to happen?!” \n\nRick bared his teeth. “Only if you ignore consequences. Which I do. Hang on!”\n\nThe room shook, consoles sparking, as the portal ballooned—then snapped, blinding white.\n\nSilence.
