{"response":"**Primary Location:**  \n*The Ruined Citadel of Meta-Reality*  \nA psychedelic labyrinth at the center of the multiverse, where reality bends under the weight of every trope, meme, and narrative cliché. Corridors flicker between animation styles and comic panels, physics change on a whim, and existential graffiti fills the walls (\"LOL, nothing matters!\"). Here, Deadpool, Rick, and Morty confront the villain at ground zero of meta-humor. The Citadel becomes both literal battleground and metaphor for their self-awareness overload.\n\n**Secondary Locations:**  \n1. *Morty’s Garage* (Earth C-137)  \nRick’s cluttered garage of gadgets and portals: a familiar launchpad—and occasional refuge—where the team regroups, argues, and attempts to ground themselves amid the madness.\n\n2. *Deadpool’s Comic Book Panels*  \nA rapidly shifting landscape, where dialogue balloons float in the air, panel borders can be weaponized, and narrative captions play tricks. Serves as both backdrop and character battleground, highlighting Deadpool’s world and how easily the story can slip into total absurdity.\n\n3. *The Void Between Universes*  \nA surreal, star-streaked expanse filled with broken punchlines and abandoned fan theories. Here, the trio faces moments of bleak introspection—the empty spaces where all their bravado falls away.\n\n**Why These Settings Matter:**  \nEvery location reflects the characters’ inner turmoil and their struggle to connect in a world where nothing is stable or truly \"real.\" The shifting, fourth-wall-breaking environments force Deadpool, Rick, and Morty to confront what happens when jokes are no longer enough to shield them from existential crisis—pushing them toward genuine self-discovery amidst chaos.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:26:31.237954-04:00"}
