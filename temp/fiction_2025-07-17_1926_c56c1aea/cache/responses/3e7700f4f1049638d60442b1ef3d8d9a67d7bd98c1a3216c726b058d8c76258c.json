{"response":"Certainly! Here’s a revised version of Chapter 14, improved for character consistency, plot continuity, foreshadowing and callbacks, transitions, and internal consistency—while retaining your signature style, structure, and events.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 14**\n\nRick slammed the lid down on the portal gun, spraying a constellation of sparks across the garage’s already battle-scarred floor. “All right, Morty! Deadpool! Stand back unless you want your atoms smeared across meta-space like a Jackson Pollock of disappointment.”\n\nMorty immediately shrank back, wringing his hands. “Uhh, Rick? Is it supposed to make that—like, that *grinding* noise? Because last time it made that noise we spent three hours as reversible pancakes.”\n\nThe device rattled harder, lights jittering wildly—like a panic attack on disco night.\n\nDeadpool, unimpressed, wagged his katanas at the whirring mess. “Pal, my digestive tract puts up scarier performances after Taco Tuesday. Are you sure you didn’t just hotwire your coffee maker to existential dread?”\n\nRick glared at Deadpool, veins bulging. “Who wouldn’t weaponize a kitchen appliance if it meant saving reality? Don’t answer that.” He hoisted the sparking contraption, eyes ablaze. “Behold! The Meta-Mangler, patent pending. This baby’ll dampen the meta-humor bleed before we all get punchlined out of existence.”\n\nMorty edged closer, peering at the machine as if it might sprout teeth. “So, like, it’ll *fix* the narrative leakage, right? Just…won’t it, I dunno, accidentally delete us from reality if you push the wrong thing?”\n\nDeadpool clapped Morty on the back. “Worst case, we reappear in a rerun of *Gilligan’s Island*. You ever seen what happens to continuity errors on that show?”\n\nRick rolled his eyes, jamming a screwdriver deep into the portal gun’s guts. “Less babble, more fetch. Morty—get the Stabilizer McGuffin. Looks like a blue Slinky spooning a potato. Top shelf.”\n\nMorty scurried, side-stepping a heap of garage debris—(Hey, was that the plumbus from Season 2?)—and emerged with the device, nearly dropping it when blue static nipped his fingers.\n\nDeadpool struck a melodramatic pose. “Marvel meets Adult Swim—this was inevitable. Let’s patch the plot holes before the plot holes eat us.”\n\nRick snatched the Stabilizer and slammed it into the Meta-Mangler. For a breath, the world held its tongue.\n\nA pulse of ultraviolet light swept the garage. The air felt taut with expectation, the fate of infinite punchlines teetering on Rick’s next move.\n\nJust then, Morty yelped—“Uh, Rick? There’s, like… *smoke* coming out of the portal gun now?”\n\nRick, sweat beading under his lab coat, didn’t look up. “Quantum exhaust, Morty, not smoke. Totally different flavor of ‘we might die.’” He twisted a tangle of wires with fearless abandon.\n\nDeadpool, ever unphased, climbed atop a bench, legs kicking. “Hey, Rick, if your quantum exhaust is sentient, I got a hamper with its name all over it.”\n\nA blue arc of energy zapped past his foot, singeing the hem. Deadpool grinned beneath the mask. “That’s the closest thing I’ve had to a spa day in months.”\n\nRick gritted his teeth, yanking the last wire into place.\n\nThe portal gun bleeped twice, belched out a translucent, giggling emoji, which zipped in frantic loops around the garage. Deadpool dove after it—crash!—colliding headlong with Rick’s bottle collection and triggering a symphony of glass.\n\nMorty ducked beneath the workbench. “Rick, please tell me emojis aren’t supposed to come out of your inventions.”\n\nRick, wiping a fresh oil smear on his coat, huffed. “Meta-energy is unpredictable. It can manifest as memes, bad puns, physical manifestations of cringe, whatever. If I see a dancing banana, I’m quitting science.”\n\nA rapid beep erupted—a shriller, more insistent note. Rick’s brow knotted. “Don’t like that beep, Morty. Usually means someone else is tuning the meta-frequency.” He shot a look at the portal gun’s display. “If I’m reading this right, the villain just ramped up the meta broadcast. Expect things to get…leakier.”\n\nDeadpool perked up, swords spinning. “Leakier is my brand! Let’s go meta-mashing before our eyeballs start speaking in hashtag.”\n\nRick tore open the garage door. “No more stalling. If we don’t jam the Multinarrative before the broadcast, we’re all toast. And not the fun, buttery kind.”\n\nMorty hesitated, staring down at his trembling hands. “Last time you said ‘no more stalling’ we spent a week in musical montage reality, Rick…”\n\nDeadpool pointedly addressed the ceiling as though addressing the cosmic narrators themselves. “If someone’s out there rebooting our genre every ten minutes, at least let me keep the merchandise rights.”\n\nRick rolled his eyes as he reached for the final component. “Deadpool, stick to stabbing. Morty, stick to not wetting yourself. Me? I’ll stick to god-level improvisation.”\n\nSuddenly, the bench *lurched* with a thunderous pop. Purple sparks danced over Deadpool’s swords, and a half-eaten pizza nearly slid off the table.\n\n“Hand me the quantum widget. No, the other glowy one,” Rick barked, coughing through the haze.\n\nMorty, choking slightly, fumbled the part to Rick. Deadpool yawned, mask rolled up to his nose, crunching on cooled pizza. “Shouldn’t someone maybe call a fire department or the TVA?”\n\nRick snatched the widget and sneered. “Why does every Morty panic the same way across the multiverse? And you—” He turned to Deadpool. “If you’re eating, at least mop up some of the radioactive grease.”\n\nBefore Rick could raise another complaint, the repaired portal gun buzzed. Circuits merged, lighting up in a pulsing purple glow. “Still got it,” Rick smirked, just as a stuttering, *pixelated distortion* cascaded through the entire garage.\n\nThe room *shuddered*. For a moment, the edges of reality sharpened—comic panel borders sliced through shelves and lights. Word balloons drooped from the ceiling; stray caption boxes blinked above Morty’s head: [NERVOUSNESS INTENSIFIES].\n\nDeadpool whistled. “Anyone else feel a software update coming on? If Jim Lee starts penciling my abs, I demand royalties.”\n\nFrom the ceiling, blocky text flickered: “CHARACTERS SUFFER SEVERE META-OVERLOAD.”\n\nMorty gulped. “Are we supposed to see our own narrative glue melting?” He glanced at Rick, panic in every syllable.\n\nA distant, static-laced *chuckle* echoed—a voice with undertones almost too familiar, as if the villain had been lurking in the gutters between panels all along.\n\nRick’s complexion blanched, the portal gun in his hand warping—turning half two-dimensional, dripping unreality through his fingers.\n\nHe locked eyes with Deadpool. “We’re nearly through the last wall, Wade.”\n\nDeadpool leaned in toward…well, us. “Don’t touch that dial, folks. This is where it gets really weird.”\n\n---\n\n*End of Chapter 14*","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:45:49.435521-04:00"}
