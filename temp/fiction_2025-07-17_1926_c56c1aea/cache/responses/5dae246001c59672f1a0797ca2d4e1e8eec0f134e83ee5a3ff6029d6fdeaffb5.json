{"response":"Morty peeked nervously over a pile of scorched binders as Rick feverishly soldered wires into the blinking, jury-rigged shell of the portal generator. Deadpool, tapping a katana on his shoulder like a bored shopper in the world’s most hazardous Costco, meandered through the debris with the air of someone looking for trouble, or maybe just the remote.\n\n\"So... this is the big fix-it plan?\" Deadpool jabbed a toe at the generator. \"Reminds me of my sophomore science project. I also incorporated the threat of total bodily annihilation.\"\n\nRick didn’t look up, his tongue poking from the corner of his mouth. “Unless you want to be molecular salsa, don’t interrupt. Some of us are busy getting us un-cancelled from existence.”\n\nMorty warily edged toward Deadpool, clutching a burrito like a life preserver. “Hey, uh, Mister Pool? You really think we’re gonna make it back? Rick sounds, um, less confident than usual.”\n\nDeadpool squatted, bringing his masked face down to Morty’s level. “Listen, kid. You ever watch a season finale and think, ‘Wow, they’re really just making this up as they go?’ Life’s basically that, but with more intestines.”\n\nMorty blinked. “I don’t know if that makes me feel better or worse.”\n\n“I aim for ambiguous!” Deadpool finger-gunned him.\n\nA sudden, electric *crack* cut the air—green-blue sparks arced from the generator, crawling up the sides of the portal frame. Rick whooped, “All right, moment of truth! If this backfires, someone erase my browser history.”\n\n“Get behind me, burrito boy,” Deadpool declared, scooping Morty and dragging him behind an overturned desk just as the generator’s hum crescendoed. The air warped, reality rippling like a wrinkled cartoon cel.\n\nWith a thunderclap, a new portal yawned open, flickering ominously—less “stargate” and more “eldritch screen saver.” The trio exchanged uneasy glances as the energies spilled more meta-chaos into the room, beckoning them toward whatever awaited beyond.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:33:58.483046-04:00"}
