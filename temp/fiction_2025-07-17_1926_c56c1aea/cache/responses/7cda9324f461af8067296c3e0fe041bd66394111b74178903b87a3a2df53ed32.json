{"response":"Rick slammed the lid down on the portal gun, sending a spray of sparks fizzling to the stained concrete floor. “All right, Morty! Deadpool! Stand back unless you wanna spend the rest of your life as Schrödinger’s disappointment.”\n\nMorty flinched, inching away. “Uh, is— is that thing supposed to make that noise?” The gun vibrated ominously, lights strobed across its surface like a rave in a blender.\n\nDeadpool, unfazed, twirled his katanas idly and cocked his head at the cacophonous gadget. “That’s nothing. My bowels make scarier noises after Taco Tuesday. Seriously, Rick, you sure you didn’t just rewire a toaster?”\n\nRick glared, veins bulging. “Unlike SOME people, I wouldn’t weaponize bread—” He paused, eyes narrowing at Deadpool. “...Okay, maybe once. But this is different. This—” He hefted the sparking contraption with pride, “is the Meta-Mangler. It’ll stabilize the meta-humor bleed before it turns our brains to literal punchlines.”\n\nMorty shuffled closer, glancing worriedly at the device. “So it’s gonna, what, zap the meta-energy? Won’t that, like, erase us or something?”\n\nDeadpool grinned, voice dropping theatrically. “Dun dun dun! What if we never existed? Is reality just—” He waggled his fingers and whispered, “—bad improv?”\n\nRick cut him off, shoving a screwdriver between sparking wires. “Less existential babble, more shutting up!” The gun bleeped triumphantly. He wiped his brow. “Now, someone grab the Stabilizer McGuffin from the shelf. Looks like a blue slinky wrapped around a potato.”\n\nMorty scrambled for the shelf as Deadpool struck a melodramatic pose. “We got this, folks! Marvel meets Adult Swim, coming to theaters never. Let’s save the multiverse so we can get back to ignoring our feelings!”\n\nMorty thrust the Stabilizer into Rick’s hand. Rick jammed it into the Meta-Mangler—there was a whistle, a surge of violet light, and the air seemed to twist—\n\nEverything went still, the fate of endless realities teetering on what happened next.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:35:54.994916-04:00"}
