{"response":"Morty’s eyes widened as Deadpool, standing triumphantly atop the counter, began using a spatula as a makeshift microphone. “Good morning, my trans-dimensional test subjects!” he called out, gesturing dramatically. Rick groaned, ignoring him in favor of stirring a questionable green liquid in a beaker, his lab coat stained with what might have been ketchup—or possibly blood.\n\n“Wade, what the hell are you doing on my kitchen counter?” Rick snapped, not looking up.\n\nDeadpool grinned behind his mask. “Running the most important strategy meeting of our lives! Also, providing excellent aerobic exercise for your fruit flies. You’re welcome.”\n\nMorty shrank back into his chair, glancing warily at Deadpool’s swords, the tip of one currently teetering between his pancakes. “Uh… what’s the plan, exactly?”\n\nRick yanked the beaker off its burner, sending a puff of purple steam curling into the air. “The plan is to get the hell out of this mess before breakfast becomes brunch. Meta-humor manipulator is already tearing holes in reality. And now—you.” He gestured accusingly at Wade. “—have somehow made things worse.”\n\nDeadpool jumped down, landing with exaggerated superhero flair. “You say potato, I say plot potato,” he quipped, kicking aside a half-melted spatula. “Look, if we’re gonna stop Mister Mimesis from turning all of existence into a live-action meme, we gotta work together! That means… team-building exercises!” He flashed two thumbs up.\n\nRick looked horrified. “Nope. Absolutely not. If I wanted therapy, I’d replace my frontal lobe with a folding chair and just sit on my own face.”\n\nMorty hesitated, the absurdity of the moment almost too much. Still, he managed, “Guys? Do we have an actual plan that doesn’t involve trust falls or… whatever Deadpool’s doing?”\n\nDeadpool winked. “I call this move the ‘Dysfunctional Family Breakfast!’”\n\nRick dropped his beaker, glass shattering.\n\nA portal sparked to life in the corner of the kitchen.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:31:51.723484-04:00"}
