{"response":"Deadpool hurled himself through the glass window, somersaulting into chaos. It was Tuesday – or as he preferred to call it, “Carnage and Chimichangas Day.” Inside the abandoned warehouse, mobsters scattered like cockroaches under a fluorescent light. Bullets pinged off crates and ricocheted through the gloom.  \n\nHe stood up, nonchalantly brushing glass off his suit. “Gentlemen, as much as I appreciate the impromptu bullet ballet, I left my tutu at home.”  \n\n“Get him!” barked a thug with improbable mutton chops.  \n\nDeadpool dodged a hail of gunfire, pirouetting through the air with all the grace of a deranged ballerina. He landed behind a stack of barrels, winking at the audience—no one in particular, but maybe you—or maybe just the dusty security camera drooping in the corner.  \n\nHe drew his katanas with a flourish. “All right, boys. Let’s make this PG-13. Nah, who am I kidding.” He vaulted the barrels, slicing through gun barrels and kicking pistols from trembling hands.  \n\nThe mutton-chopped goon rushed him with a crowbar. Deadpool sidestepped, caught the goon’s arm, and whispered, “Sorry, pal, but crowbars belong in clown college.” He flung the thug straight into a stack of counterfeit CDs labeled “Best of Smash Mouth.”  \n\nSomewhere, a cellphone vibrated—“All Star” as the ringtone. Deadpool tucked a stray pistol behind his back, answering through his mask. “Deadpool speaking! No, I do NOT want to extend my car’s warranty–wait, what?”  \n\nThe phone sparked, fizzled. For a split-second, Deadpool caught a flicker in the air: a glitch, like reality’s tape snagging. The warehouse walls seemed to shimmer, and then—snap—it was gone. He stared.  \n\n“That’s not in the script,” he muttered. Then, to us: “Did you see that? Seriously, if I start randomly turning into an anime girl, blame the writers.”  \n\nHe started forward, katanas at the ready, as the air crackled again.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:30:36.130577-04:00"}
