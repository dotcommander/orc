{"response":"Morty’s sneakers squeaked as he scrambled away from the disassembled portal gun, hands shielding his head. “Uh, Rick? Should there be *that* much smoke?”\n\nRick barely glanced up, fingers flying through the tangle of wires. “It’s not smoke, Morty. It’s, uh, semi-sentient quantum exhaust. Totally different flavor of life-threatening.”\n\nDeadpool hopped onto the edge of the workbench, legs swinging. “Can semi-sentient exhaust do my laundry? Asking for a friend who’s me. I leak a lot.”\n\nA burst of blue energy arced dangerously close to Deadpool’s boot. He twitched, grinning beneath his mask. “Or maybe just exfoliate.”\n\n“Would you both shut up?” Rick snapped, tongue poking out in concentration. “I only get one shot at re-tuning the humor frequency, and if I cross these wires—” He connected two leads with a spark. The portal gun shivered—then belched out a translucent, giggling emoji that zipped around the garage.\n\n“Dibs!” Deadpool lunged at the emoji, only to crash into a stack of Rick’s half-empty bottles. He sat up, glass in his lap, grin unbroken.\n\n“Rick, was that supposed to happen?” Morty peered over the bench, eyes wide as saucers.\n\nRick shrugged, smearing a smear of oil across his lab coat. “Meta-humor is unstable! It could manifest as anything—jokes, memes, psychic punchlines. Or...horrifying puns.”\n\nA rhythmic beeping filled the air. Rick’s eyes narrowed. “That’s *not* a good beep.”\n\nMorty clutched his shirt. “What now?”\n\nRick stared at the portal gun’s flickering lights. “If my calculations are right, the villain just tweaked the meta broadcast. Reality’s about to get weirder. Expect… complications.”\n\nDeadpool perked up, twin katanas glinting as he bounced to his feet. “Weirder? That’s practically my mating call. Let’s go meta-mashing!”\n\nRick grabbed the portal gun and motioned to the garage door, steeling himself. “No turning back now. Time to punch through the funny bone of the multiverse.”","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:36:05.44238-04:00"}
