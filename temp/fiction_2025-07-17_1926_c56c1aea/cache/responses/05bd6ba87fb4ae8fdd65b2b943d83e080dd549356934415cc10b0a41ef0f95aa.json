{"response":"**Hook:**  \nDeadpool, mid-battle with fourth-wall-breaking commentary, literally bursts through a cosmic portal—smashing straight into Rick’s garage during a particularly unstable experiment, splattering chimichangas everywhere and leaving Morty screaming.\n\n**Inciting Event:**  \nAs the universe glitches around them, a new, reality-bending villain emerges: The Meme Weaver—an entity who weaponizes meta-humor and threatens to dissolve their worlds into nonsense if not stopped.\n\n**Rising Action:**  \nReluctantly teaming up, Deadpool, Rick, and Morty leap across increasingly absurd multiverses, facing parody versions of themselves and grappling with their own defenses—Deadpool’s manic violence, Rick’s cynical nihilism, and Morty’s awkward sarcasm—while The Meme Weaver corrupts reality faster and faster.\n\n**Climax:**  \nCornered in the collapsing meta-reality, the trio confront The Meme Weaver; only by dropping their own personas and embracing authenticity—for just a moment—can they break the villain’s hold and restore the fourth wall.\n\n**Falling Action:**  \nDisoriented but victorious, Deadpool, Rick, and Morty attempt to return to their own universes, changed by their brief connection and a new understanding of their own emotional walls.\n\n**Resolution:**  \nThough separated once again, each character makes a genuine effort in their own world: Rick leaves his portal gun with Morty for safekeeping, Deadpool leaves a heartfelt (and ridiculous) note behind, and Morty finally stands up for himself—suggesting that even in a world built on jokes, real meaning is possible.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:26:39.882837-04:00"}
