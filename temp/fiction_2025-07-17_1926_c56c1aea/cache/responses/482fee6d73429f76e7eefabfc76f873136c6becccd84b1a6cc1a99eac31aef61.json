{"response":"Deadpool stopped mid-stride, staring slack-jawed as the swirling code of the multiverse flickered around them. Panels of comic art peeled away like errant wallpaper, exposing raw, pulsating grids beneath. “Y’know, I didn’t mind a little fourth-wall shenanigans, but this is starting to feel like a techno rave in a blender,” he quipped, spinning his katanas for comfort.\n\nRick was hunched over his portal gun, furiously recalibrating the dials. “Someone’s jamming the multiversal frequency with meta-constructs. Reality’s undergoing *editorial revision*, and we’re ground zero.” His face was all determination and eye bags.\n\nMorty gazed around with wide eyes. Giant floating hashtags and scrolling ‘LAUGH TRACK’ banners twisted overhead like storm clouds. “Uh—guys, I think I’m allergic to this much irony.”\n\nA pixelated version of Deadpool zipped by, trailing exaggerated winks and airhorn memes. Deadpool tackled it, arms flailing. “Finally, some competition! Gimme back my *brand*, poser!”\n\nThe fake ‘Pool dissolved into a mess of error messages, shrieking “LOL SORRY, CANON VIOLATION” before evaporating.\n\nMorty edged closer to Rick. “So, what’s the plan? I-I’m not ready to get deleted by a snarky subtitle.”\n\nRick eyed the unraveling horizon, grimacing. “We override the punchline engine. I get us to the nucleus. Deadpool, you’ll need to cut through a few jokes—literally. Morty, just… try not to existentially combust.”\n\nDeadpool straightened, twirling a katana. “Heroic sacrifice vibe, got it. Been there, stabbed that. Lead the way, Doc—before my speech bubbles start quoting Garfield.”\n\nJust then, a hole tore in the pixelated floor, revealing a descending staircase with ‘PLOT PROGRESSION’ flickering in neon.\n\nRick cocked an eyebrow. “Well, subtlety’s dead. Let’s move.”\n\nThey sprinted toward the stairs, the world reformatting behind them as they dove into the next layer of madness.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:33:13.977677-04:00"}
