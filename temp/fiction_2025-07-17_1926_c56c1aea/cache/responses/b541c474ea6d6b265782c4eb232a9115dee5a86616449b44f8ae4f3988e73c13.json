{"response":"Deadpool shot up from his roll, dual katanas unsheathed before he touched the ground. “Greetings, illegal tax evaders!” he quipped, fingers waggling in salute. Around him, six hard-faced mobsters spun, their confusion as thick as the cologne in the air.  \n\n“Who the hell—” barked the one in the pinstripe suit.  \n\nDeadpool twirled his swords, heedless of guns being drawn. “Who am I? Glad you asked! Just your everyday crime-stopping, fourth-wall-busting, chimichanga-loving nightmare.” He winked directly at a broken security camera, as if its red recording light demanded acknowledgment.  \n\nBullets screamed. Deadpool pirouetted between crates, letting the mobsters’ aim slice new holes in the faded wallpaper. “Jeez, Tony! You can’t buy marksmanship like that. Actually, you totally can, but clearly you didn’t.” A round grazed his shoulder; he exaggerated a flinch. “Ah, my meat-shoulder! Now how will I carry my emotional baggage?”  \n\nHe vaulted over a crate, landing mere feet from a stammering thug. The man’s hand shook so badly his pistol clattered to the floor. Deadpool leaned in, conspiratorial: “Buddy, I know it’s intimidating sharing a scene with a charismatic antihero, but let’s work through those jitters together.” He elbowed the guy in the jaw with comical gentleness—enough to knock him out cold.  \n\nSuddenly a heavier caliber tore through another crate and Deadpool ducked, faceplanting into a stack of stolen electronics. On his way down, he snatched a walkie-talkie, pressing the button with his chin. “This is Deadpool. Mobsters, one. Deadpool, all the points. Time to cash out, suckers.”  \n\nHe rolled to his feet just as the pinstripe boss hefted a rocket launcher. “Oh! New player enters the game,” Deadpool said, katanas raised. “Somebody’s compensating!”  \n\nThe boss grinned viciously—and squeezed the trigger.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:30:43.17588-04:00"}
