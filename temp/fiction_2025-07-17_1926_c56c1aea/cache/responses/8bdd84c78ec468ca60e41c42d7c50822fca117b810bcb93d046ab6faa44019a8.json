{"response":"Certainly! Here’s your improved Chapter 13, rewritten for stronger character consistency, plot flow, foreshadowing, and smoother transitions, while maintaining the core events:\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 13\n\nMorty stared at Deadpool, aghast, as the mercenary dangled the humming, sickly-green capacitor between two fingers, swinging it like the world’s most menacing Christmas ornament. “Dude! That thing could, like, scramble your DNA or—explode and turn us into sentient yogurt or—”\n\nDeadpool twirled the capacitor, unbothered. “Morty, the only things that’ve ever scrambled my DNA are bargain-bin taco trucks and bad script rewrites.” He winked at the ceiling, as if searching for cosmic cue cards. “And newsflash: I’m still here! Meta-here. Here-here. Wherever ‘here’ is.” He gave the capacitor an affectionate shake, daring it to pulse more erratically.\n\nRick snorted, reconfiguring his portal gun with frenetic, practiced hands. “Relax, Morty. If Wade’s molecules unspool, I’ll just pluck a slightly-less-screwed-up version from the next universe over. That’s the beauty of infinite mistakes—you collect the whole set,” he said, voice wavering between exhaustion and manic pride. For a brief second, neon grids from a holographic schematic played across his face, painting him thoughtful and oddly sincere.\n\nDeadpool tossed the capacitor into the air and caught it. “So, Ricky Ticky Tavi, what’s the meta-plan? Portal in, drop some quips, stick this bad boy in the big bad’s widget, save the multiverse, cue end credits?” He grinned under the mask, the kind of smile you heard more than saw.\n\nRick’s reply was a grunt, two-and-a-half syllables short of patience. “We portal in, jam this capacitor into the villain’s reality engine before Happy Hour, and pray the universe doesn’t turn into a bottle episode. But Meta-Monger’s expecting us—they’ve been one step ahead since Albuquerque.” His eyes flicked to Morty, something unspoken there.\n\nMorty chewed his lip, voice thin but determined. “What if we—I dunno—try talking to them? Every time we fight, it gets worse. What if that’s the point?”\n\nDeadpool paused mid-spin. “Whoa there, Morty. Suggesting feelings-talk over ultra-violence? Is this…actual character development? In a fourth-wall-destroying meta-comedy?” He tapped an imaginary “applause” sign.\n\nRick slouched, but there was a genuine glint in his gaze as he looked at Morty. “Kid’s not entirely wrong. This villain eats meta for breakfast. Maybe breaking the pattern is the only win condition left.”\n\nA rare hush filled the room. Three improvisers, suspended between punchline and consequence. Deadpool gave the capacitor one last twirl. “Fine. But if words fail, dibs on first round of cathartic property damage.”\n\nRick flicked on the portal gun, green energy spiraling outward in a way that felt half-science, half-narrative necessity. “Let’s not keep meta-destiny waiting.” It was almost…respectful.\n\nThey stepped forward—and as the green door snapped open, Deadpool muttered, “Worst case, I wake up with three extra nipples. That’s barely a side plot for me.” His false bravado earned a ghost of a smile from Morty.\n\nRick, already bristling with haste, snatched the capacitor out of Deadpool’s grip and clamped it onto his cluttered workbench. “Idiots, both of you. Do you have any idea how fragile the fourth wall is right now? If this blows, we’ll be demoted to a direct-to-streaming subplot—at *best*.” He flicked his tongue, wincing. “Tastes like burnt popcorn and canceled seasons of Firefly.”\n\nMorty shuffled back, arms tight across his chest. “Can we please stay on task? Meta-Monger is out there, and every time we run, it’s as if they’ve already predicted the punchline.”\n\nDeadpool didn’t miss a beat, waving at invisible cameras. “Pretty sure they did, Morty. Fourth-wall awareness isn’t just my superpower—Meta-Monger’s using narrative against us. Hi, readers! Still with us? Go fold your socks, I’ll wait.”\n\nRick ignored them both, yanking gadgets out of a tangle of wires. “Swear to god, Wade, if you fracture the narrative one more time, I’ll staple your mouth shut with quantum flux wire.” He hesitated, then: “Morty, pass me the neuro-resonator. Next to Evil Jerry’s head and the Pickle Rick figurine.”\n\nMorty retrieved the helmet, lights blinking like a malfunctioning Christmas display. “What does this do, Grandpa?”\n\nRick slapped it onto his brow. “If I amplify the narrative signal, we might suss out Meta-Monger’s next plot twist. Assuming Deadpool didn’t already short-circuit every probability node juggling the capacitor like it’s amateur hour.”\n\nDeadpool perched on the workbench, kicking his feet and grinning. “When the fourth wall goes wobbly, improvise. That’s chapter one, page one of the Deadpool playbook.”\n\nA low, foreboding hum filled the garage. Rick’s improvised tech cast warped shadows against the walls—shapes like old TV static and snippets of previous universes. For a heartbeat, all three stared: anxiety, bravado, a flicker of hope. The same uneasy hope they’d felt facing the Smash Mouth mobsters, or when reality first started bending.\n\nMorty paced in twitchy circles, glancing at the capacitor and remembering the Spaghetti Universe debacle. “Let’s just…slap it in, then?”\n\nRick snorted, eyes never leaving his tools. “It’s supposed to be precision science, but Wade’s definition of ‘slap it in’ is why we have two angry Meeseeks in the crawl space.”\n\nDeadpool sidled up beside Morty, laying a hand on his shaking shoulder. “Hey, kid, if this gets all pasta-nightmare again, I’ll pour one out for your former carbon-based beauty. Marinara in your honor. Gluten-free if you prefer.”\n\n“At least someone’s thinking ahead,” Morty muttered, too anxious to laugh.\n\nRick jammed the capacitor into the waiting mount on his souped-up portal gun. Exposed wires sparked, releasing the acrid whiff of ozone and day-old chimichanga. “All right, moment of truth. If this armageddons us, just remember to blame the narrator.”\n\nMorty stepped back, eyes darting to every memory of previous chaos. “Is it even…stable?”\n\n“‘Stable’ is a concept invented by cowards, Morty,” Rick said, mouth twisting. “Deadpool, congratulations: you’re up. Try not to do any improv surgery on the gun. Again.”\n\nDeadpool seized the weapon, reveling in the moment. “If this is my untimely end, please commission at least one tasteful stained glass window of my buttocks.” He aimed.\n\nRick and Morty held their breath.\n\nDeadpool squeezed the trigger—\n\nThe gun shrieked and crackled. A portal blossomed, rippling with colors not meant for mortal eyes—and from its depths came the chilling, familiar echo of Meta-Monger’s laughter.\n\nRick steadied himself. Morty clutched the neuro-resonator like a talisman. Deadpool straightened, swords at the ready, grin sharp beneath his mask.\n\nTogether, they stepped through into the unknown—knowing, at last, that winning might mean rewriting more than just the script.\n\n---","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:45:18.893944-04:00"}
