{"response":"Morty clings to the banister, eyes wide as the world flickers between realities with every step. “Uh, guys? Does anyone else feel like they’re about to puke in three different timelines at once?”\n\nDeadpool waves a hand, feigning calm. “Just keep your arms and existential crises inside the stairwell at all times, folks. If you see a version of yourself with a mustache, don’t trust him. He’s evil.” He winks at Morty—the kind of wink that never reassures anyone.\n\nRick grunts, squinting as the walls ripple, cycling through colors and textures like a bad fever dream. “The meta-oscillator’s close. Reality’s hemorrhaging both tropes and taste. Not that we had much of either to begin with.” His portal gun buzzes, its readings spiking between the numbers and tired punchlines.\n\nA painting on the wall blinks—no, actually blinks—then sighs dramatically. “More fourth wall breakage? Do you guys ever just walk quietly?” Deadpool snaps off a two-finger salute. “Sorry, Mona Lisa, our sense of subtlety’s out of order. Try again next gas leak!”\n\nMorty stumbles, stepping onto a stair that momentarily becomes a cartoon trampoline. He yelps, flailing to stay upright as the air fills with floating question marks. “Is…is this what having self-awareness feels like? I hate it!”\n\nRick yanks him back to solid ground, muttering, “Nothing new. You kids and your overexposed narrative devices.” He spins on Deadpool, tone sharp. “Listen. We overload the meta-oscillator, but if any of us gets too cute, reality goes full improv set. And no one wants to die in a deleted scene.”\n\nDeadpool claps his hands, excitement and nerves leaking through. “Alright, final boss time. Who’s got the most unresolved personal trauma?”  \n\nThe staircase lands them in front of a door labeled: “No Plot Armor Beyond This Point.” All three pause. Deadpool gives a mock salute, Rick curses under his breath, and Morty just gulps, reaching for the handle.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:38:20.444049-04:00"}
