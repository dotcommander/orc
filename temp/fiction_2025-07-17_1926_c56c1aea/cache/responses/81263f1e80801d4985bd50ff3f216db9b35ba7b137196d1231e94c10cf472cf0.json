{"response":"Certainly! Here’s a version of **Chapter 12** trimmed by approximately 110 words (now near 1,000 words), made leaner by cutting redundancies, tightening dialogue, and sharpening action/description. The core story, tension, humor, and stakes remain intact.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 12 (Streamlined, ~1,000 words)\n\nRick was elbow-deep in his jury-rigged contraption, sweat beading on his brow. “Morty, hand me the—no, not the femur. The *quantum* capacitor. It’s the one vibrating with existential dread. Tuesdays suck enough as it is.”\n\nMorty scuttled through precarious gadget piles, side-eyeing a puddle of neon ooze. “Are you sure this won’t, like, explode? Last ‘safe’ plan, Grandpa, we got chased by clown guys. They, uh, still text me sometimes.”\n\nRick shot him a glare. “Clowns were mercy compared to what’s next. And quit the texting drama, Morty, I’m working.” He jerked his chin at Deadpool, perched atop a throne of broken vending machines, a crown of soda cans on his head.\n\nDeadpool tapped his makeshift scepter with a mock-royal wave. “Hey! I bring moral support, creative chaos, and snack analysis. Superhero multitasking, baby.”\n\nMorty rolled his eyes. “Honestly, I’d just settle for pants that fit. Or, y’know, not dying today.”\n\nRick’s device crackled; lights flickered cyan. “Quiet. I’m about to quantum-splice narrative resonance—just hand me the Snickers before reality gets hungry.”\n\nDeadpool lobbed the candy bar over. “Nourish the mind, clog the plot. Should I stand guard for cosmic goons or maybe the next plot twist?”\n\nRick tore open the wrapper. “Just can the fourth-wall commentary—the villain’s tracking meta-leaks, and we reek of foreshadowing.”\n\nMorty eyed the humming machine—wires and dials topped by a sticker: “Caution: Contains Plot Holes.” “Uh…is it supposed to glow, or should I Google ‘what to do when the timeline melts’?”\n\nRick snorted, chocolate smearing his stubble. “That means it’s working, Morty. Welcome to Chapter 12, say goodbye to making sense.”\n\nMorty gingerly snatched up the quantum capacitor, which buzzed out the faint tune of “All Star.” He hesitated. “Do I need gloves? Hazmat? …Blind faith?”\n\nRick snapped his fingers. “Just hand it over before your existential crisis causes a reset.”\n\nMorty gulped and did, and the air instantly soured—scorched popcorn and regret. Deadpool, perched atop a smashed arcade cabinet, sighed. “So…does this thing zap, pop, or call in a Michael Bay cameo? I need to time my freakout.”\n\nRick kept working. “If you panic, Deadpool, that’s Plan B. If you suck the meta-humor out, we still win.”\n\nDeadpool hopped down, unsheathing katanas. “Cue existential improv. Yell if you want me to monologue.”\n\nMorty watched, nerves jangling. Their “workshop”—just a collapsing comic shop—reeked of ozone and panic. “If the villain’s hacking the script, aren’t we just playing along?”\n\nRick jammed in the capacitor; the device vibrated, casting warped shadows on ancient, moldy *Uncanny X-Men*. “If cliché is bait, we’re smashing it. That’s why Deadpool’s here: he’s loud chaos in red spandex.”\n\nDeadpool fired finger guns. “My self-awareness is a superpower! Where do I stand for max irony, Cap’n Science?”\n\nThe machine coughed—static, then a deep, muffled laugh echoing through the walls. Rick's shaking hand wiped sweat from his brow. “When the villain laughs, it’s a weapon. Steals your agency right out the earholes.”\n\nDeadpool winked. “No promises, Doc. Jokes are my immune system. Morty, did you spring for existential insurance yet?”\n\nMorty started to reply, but the floor lurched. Word-balloons oozed from cracks: “BOOM.” “IRONY.” “WHOOPS.” He hugged a pillar as static rattled his bones.\n\nDeadpool leapt atop a console, snatching the capacitor from Morty’s hand. “Relax, kid. I’ve eaten tacos way deadlier.” Blue sparks crawled up his sleeve. “Rick, is brain static supposed to taste like déjà vu?”\n\nRick snatched the part back, belching. “Don’t drop it, unless you want quantum indigestion. Or to see your kidneys in five dimensions.”\n\nMorty scrambled behind a board game stack. “If meme-humor’s deadly, shouldn’t we, uh, triple-wrap Deadpool in tinfoil? Or just run?”\n\nDeadpool shrugged. “If meta could kill me, I’d be a punchline in issue one. Bring it.”\n\nA boom overhead—dust sifting down. Red lights flickered, spelling “PLOT ESCALATES” on the ceiling. Deadpool shielded his eyes. “Finally, a clue. Rick, is the doomsday Furby ready?”\n\nRick scowled, adjusting dials. “Stall the goons for five seconds—no heroics.”\n\nNo time. From the shattered storefront came heavy footfalls, the clatter of keyboards. Meme-faced goons stormed in: heads flickering from Shrek to Doge to Big Chungus, glitching with every step.\n\nOne pointed at Deadpool. “Much wow. Very dead.”\n\nDeadpool spun his katanas, bowing. “Welcome to the roast, gentlemen. Tips accepted—funeral funds preferred. If I fall in this meme war, pick a better hashtag.”\n\nMorty, adrenaline surging, snatched up a wrench labeled “Deluxe Deus Ex Machina.” The meme-minions advanced, trailing static as scenes from their past flickered between the cracks: the warehouse, Smash Mouth CDs, grinning clowns.\n\nRick’s device shrieked, lights spinning into crescendo as the trio drew together, the line between ridiculous and dangerous razor-thin.\n\nThis was it—the punchline set up since the start. Deadpool gave the cue: “Everyone ready to break the fourth wall? On one, three, or when the narrator blinks?”\n\nThe world snapped into chaos.\n\nAnd somewhere beyond, the meta-villain started laughing.\n\n---","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:59:11.139379-04:00"}
