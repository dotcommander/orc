{"response":"Morty peeked out from behind the sparking console, flinching as another cable popped loose and whipped against the lab wall. “Rick, I really don’t think this is a good idea. What if it opens—like—a black hole again? Or turns Deadpool into more Deadpools?”  \n\nRick, sweat soaking his uni-brow, jabbed a screwdriver into a glowing core. “Morty, please. The odds of a dimensional rift multiplying Deadpool are only at, like, thirteen percent. Maybe fifteen now that you made me think about it. You want to give up and let Comedy Prime wipe out irony, meta-humor, and—” His burp interrupted the rant. “—my entire reason for existing?”  \n\nDeadpool, sprawled across Rick’s cluttered workbench, kicked his heels while flipping a thumb drive between gloved fingers. “Hey, in fairness, I wouldn’t mind having, like, a dozen me’s. Think of the chimichanga runs! The snappy comebacks!” He tossed the thumb drive up; it narrowly missed a plasma coil. “Whoopsie, almost made everything go kaboom. You sure you want me here, science grandpa?”  \n\nRick snatched the drive from midair. “Shut up and plug this into the humor core, Wade. Your brand of fourth-wall-breaking idiocy might actually stabilize the charge.”  \n\nDeadpool saluted, exaggerating it until his elbow thunked against a jar of glowing pickles that wriggled ominously. “On it, General Drunky.” He shimmied over and jammed the drive into the humor core. The room trembled.  \n\nMorty yelped, darting to Rick’s side. “Rick! It’s working… or I think it’s working? Are we supposed to see cartoon sweat beads forming on your forehead?”  \n\n“That’s just fourth-degree irony, Morty. Totally under control,” Rick lied, a crackling arc of energy jumping between his eyebrows.  \n\nDeadpool grinned behind his mask. “Gentlemen, get ready to break the fourth wall so hard, we might need a fifth mortgage.”","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:34:15.231847-04:00"}
