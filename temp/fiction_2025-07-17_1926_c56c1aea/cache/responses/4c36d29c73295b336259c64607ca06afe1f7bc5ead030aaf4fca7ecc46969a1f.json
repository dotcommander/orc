{"response":"The air rippled with static, every breath tinged with ozone and the scent of overused punchlines. Deadpool’s gloved fingers curled into a fist, his eyes darting between the shifting grids overhead and Rick, who was busy calibrating a whirring device that looked suspiciously like a blender with too many antennas.\n\n“So, we’re just gonna ignore the fact reality’s coming apart like a cheap piñata at a kid’s birthday?” Deadpool quipped, trying to keep things light—and mostly failing. His voice bounced off the exposed code, warping in weirdly satisfying ways.\n\nMorty flinched, pressing himself closer to Rick’s lab coat. “Uh, Rick? Exactly how screwed are we on a scale from ‘Disney lawsuit’ to ‘existential void?’”\n\nRick didn’t look up. “Morty, language. Also, we’re so far past screwed that—” He jabbed at the device, making it sputter, then catch, emitting a sound like a sitcom laugh track in reverse. “—it’s basically experimental jazz at this point. Just hold still.”\n\nDeadpool arched an eyebrow behind his mask. “You know, I’m used to reality breakdowns, Rick. But usually, the only thing peeling is my skin.”\n\nRick snorted. “What’s peeling now is your sense of narrative importance. Shut up for a sec—”\n\nHe slammed a button. The world convulsed. Panels tore away, revealing not characters, but thought bubbles tangled in a knot—sentences looping endlessly, all self-referential. Deadpool reached out, his hand passing through one, feeling the words tingle across his wrist.\n\n“Feels... itchy,” he muttered. “Anyone else itchy?”\n\nMorty shook his head, wide-eyed. “No, just terrified.”\n\nRick grinned, wild and unhinged. “Perfect. The meta-humor algorithm’s losing cohesion. If we push it any further, the villain’s hiding spot might just—”\n\nA bolt of neon logic zipped overhead, splitting another panel with a deafening *crack*.\n\nDeadpool cocked his head. “You were saying?”\n\nRick cocked the device like a shotgun. “I’m saying: get ready to jump.”","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:33:20.584349-04:00"}
