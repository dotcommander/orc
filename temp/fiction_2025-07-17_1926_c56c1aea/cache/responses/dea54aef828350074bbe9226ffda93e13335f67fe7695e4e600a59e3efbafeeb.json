{"response":"Morty tried to steady his trembling hand as he entered the neon-lit corridor, trailing behind Deadpool. The walls shimmered with streaks of glitching code; occasional pop-ups blinked midair—a disembodied fortune cookie declared, “This moment brought to you by product placement!” before imploding in a shower of digital confetti.\n\nDeadpool stopped short, causing Morty to stumble and nearly collide with his red-and-black suit. \"Welcome to the Nexus of Narrative Inconsistencies!\" Wade announced, arms wide as if unveiling a theme park nobody wanted to visit. “Mind the plot holes—they bite.”\n\nMorty nervously glanced behind them. “Uh, Deadpool, are you sure this is the way? Last time Rick and I ended up somewhere like this, we got stuck in a bottle episode for, like, four weeks…”\n\nDeadpool grinned beneath his mask. “Bottle episodes build character, kid. This is where all the worlds go to glitch out before the writers retcon ‘em away. It’s the original dumpster fire.”\n\nA flicker at the hall’s end caught Morty’s eye: a hulking silhouette, industrial and menacing, materializing from the static. The villain—Meta-Monger—stood, face obscured by a cube of shifting memes, voice echoing in overlapping remixes of internet catchphrases. “You think a little meta-awareness makes you immune, Wade?” it intoned, tone oscillating like a corrupted file. “I’m the punchline. You’re the setup.”\n\nWithout warning, Deadpool whipped out his swords. “Chill, Tron reject. The kid and I were just passing through—got any directions to the nearest plot device?”\n\nMeta-Monger’s cube flickered, distorting the space around them. Panels peeled back, exposing sketches and script notes that threatened to rewrite reality.\n\nMorty swallowed. “Oh man, Rick’s really not going to believe this—assuming we make it out.”\n\n“Relax, Morty! Worst comes to worst, we get rebooted.” Deadpool winked at the audience. “Which is usually my Tuesday.”\n\nThe cube hummed, energy crackling. The walls began to unravel.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:32:57.605206-04:00"}
