{"response":"Certainly! Here’s a revised version of Chapter 14, focused on sharper pacing, cleaner transitions, crisp, engaging dialogue, a tighter description/action ratio, and a steady escalation of tension—all while retaining your voice and core story events.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 14**\n\nRick slammed the portal gun shut, sparks geysering across the battle-scarred garage floor. “All right, Morty! Deadpool! Stand back, unless you want your molecules scattered across meta-space like avant-garde roadkill.”\n\nMorty yanked himself back, eyes darting. “Uhh, Rick? Was it supposed to make that—like, that *metal-grinding* noise? Last time it did that we had two heads each for a week.”\n\nThe gun vibrated, lights flickering like a disco inferno in cardiac arrest.\n\nDeadpool twirled his katanas, deadpan. “Please. My digestive system’s scarier after street-meat night. Sure this isn’t just your coffee maker channeling anxiety?”\n\nRick shot him a glare. “Who wouldn’t weaponize kitchenware to save reality? Don’t answer—” He hoisted the sparking invention, feverish-eyed. “Behold: the Meta-Mangler, trademark pending. This baby’ll cap the meta-humor overflow before we all get retconned.”\n\nMorty edged closer, peering at the thing like it might sprout tentacles. “So…it fixes the narrative leakage, right? Nothing’s gonna—y’know—erase us?”\n\nDeadpool patted Morty’s back. “Worst case, we end up in a ‘Love Boat’ reboot. You ever see what happens to guest stars on that show?”\n\nRick jabbed a screwdriver into the portal gun’s guts. “Quit gabbing. Morty—fetch the Stabilizer McGuffin. Looks like a blue Slinky cuddling a potato. Top shelf.”\n\nMorty darted off, sidestepping garage litter—(was that a plumbus from Season 2?)—and fished out the device, yelping as it zapped his fingers blue.\n\nDeadpool spread his arms wide. “Marvel meets Adult Swim. Plot holes beware: we’re the spackle.”\n\nRick snatched the Stabilizer, slamming it home. Everything stilled. The air bristled with static, the fate of a billion punchlines hanging on Rick’s next twitch.\n\nUltraviolet light pulsed. Instantly, Morty’s eyes went wide. “Uhh, Rick? There’s, like, *smoke* coming out now—”\n\nRick didn’t look up, sweat streaking his brow. “Quantum exhaust, Morty. Chill. We only die if someone sneezes in four dimensions.” He twisted wires frantically.\n\nDeadpool hopped onto a bench, swinging his legs. “Rick, your quantum exhaust better not be sentient. My hamper’s full.”\n\nA blue arc zipped past, singeing Deadpool’s suit. He cackled. “Closest thing to a spa day I’ve had all year.”\n\nRick yanked the last wire. The portal gun beeped twice, then spat out a translucent, giggling emoji—which zipped around the garage.\n\nDeadpool lunged at it—*crash*—slamming into a shelf and setting bottles to chime their distress.\n\nMorty hit the floor, wide-eyed. “R-Rick? Are emojis supposed to come out of this?”\n\nRick smeared oil across his coat, exasperated. “Meta-energy’s unpredictable! Memes, puns, animate cringe, you name it. If there’s a dancing banana, I’m out.”\n\nAs if summoned, a sharp, shrill beep cut through—the urgency unmistakable.\n\nRick scowled at his device. “Don’t like that. Means someone else is hijacking the meta-wavelength. The villain’s cranking up the broadcast. Expect more leakage—fast.”\n\nDeadpool lit up, swords spinning. “Leakier is my comfort zone! Quick, before our brains start hashtagging themselves.”\n\nRick threw open the garage door. “No time to stall. If we don’t jam the Multinarrative now, we’re all toast—and not the good, buttery kind.”\n\nMorty hesitated, wringing his hands. “Last time you said ‘no stalling’ we got trapped in a musical montage, Rick—”\n\nDeadpool addressed the ceiling as if to the cosmic writers’ room. “If anyone’s rebooting us, can I keep the toy royalties this time?”\n\nRick, half-listening, grabbed the next component. “Deadpool, stick to stabbing. Morty, stick to not fainting. I’ll stick to improvising.”\n\nThe workbench shuddered, thunderous pop. Purple sparks danced across Deadpool’s blades; a half-eaten pizza slid toward the edge.\n\n“Quantum widget—no, the glowy one,” Rick barked, coughing in the haze.\n\nMorty fumbled the part, handing it over. Deadpool, mask rolled to his nose, munched pizza. “Shouldn’t someone call a fire department? Or, like, the TVA?”\n\nRick seized the widget, sneering. “All Morties panic the same across the Multiverse. And you—” He glared at Deadpool. “If you’re eating radioactive pizza, at least don’t drip on the timeline.”\n\nAs he snapped the last circuit, the portal gun glowed, purple and angry. Rick grinned. “Still got it.” \n\nA *pixelated distortion* shivered through the garage.\n\nReality bent. Comic-panel borders sliced across shelves. Caption boxes blinked overhead—[NERVOUSNESS INTENSIFIES] above Morty’s head.\n\nDeadpool whistled. “Anyone else feel like a software update’s about to brick us? If Jim Lee’s sketching my abs, I want commission.”\n\nFrom the ceiling, blocky text flickered: “CHARACTERS SUFFER SEVERE META-OVERLOAD.”\n\nMorty gulped. “Are we—are we supposed to see our narrative glue melting?”\n\nA distorted chuckle echoed—hauntingly familiar, like the villain had always lived between their panels.\n\nThe portal gun in Rick’s grip flickered, its shape twisting two-dimensional, leaking impossible color.\n\nRick locked eyes with Deadpool. “This is it. One wall left.”\n\nDeadpool leaned in toward the audience. “Don’t even blink, folks. It’s about to get seriously weird.”\n\n---\n\n*End of Chapter 14*","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:55:13.631982-04:00"}
