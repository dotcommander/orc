{"response":"Certainly! Here’s a polished, tighter version of Chapter 15, with improved character voice and consistency, enhanced callbacks and foreshadowing, smoothed transitions, and subtle tweaks for internal and plot continuity. All central action and beats will remain, but the storytelling and cohesion will be kicked up a notch:\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 15\n\nMorty ducked behind a busted arcade cabinet, his breathing shallow as neon sparks spat from the gutted portal gun, the scent of ozone curling in the ruined air. Rick hunched over the smoldering device, a screwdriver wedged between gritted teeth, firing off curses that ricocheted between quantum physics and Deadpool’s catastrophic culinary habits. The floor trembled—a subtle *whump*, then another. The rhythm pulsed like a warning, or maybe just the start of another migraine.\n\nDeadpool sauntered into view twirling his katanas like a circus drum major, one edge of his mask still smoldering from their last misadventure. “Great news, team! I bought us a distraction. Bad news: surprise, it’s me.”\n\nA lazy, metallic clap echoed through the corridor. From the greasy haze emerged their nemesis: The Stand-Up, resplendent in a glitching patchwork tuxedo, holographic bowtie flickering between realities. Microphones orbited his head like giddy, malicious moons.\n\n“Oh *fantastic*,” Rick groaned, jabbing a thumb at Deadpool. “Let this be a lesson, Morty: if you ever think your day can't get stupider, just wait for the guy in red to show up.”\n\nThe Stand-Up gave a grand bow. “Thank you, thank you! And as they say in sitcoms—‘let’s get this show on the road!’” One of his microphones jabbed toward Rick’s chest, unleashing a blare of feedback that set every arcade screen flickering.\n\nMorty risked a peek from his refuge. “Uh, you guys? I think he’s—”\n\nThe voice in the mic fractured into a torrent of one-liners, weaponized puns so groan-inducing the laws of physics winced. The floor buckled into punchlines—banana peels curled up from nowhere, anvils hung in midair, a piano wobbled with cartoon menace overhead. Deadpool leapt forward, slicing an airborne rubber chicken and firing a grin worthy of a Looney Tunes audition.\n\n“About time!” Deadpool crowed. “I was starting to think no one here respected a good callback.”\n\nThe Stand-Up cackled, launching more reality-warping jokes. Rick yanked Morty back behind the burning cabinet, shielding him from slapstick shrapnel. “If we don’t counter his material with our own, we’re toast—ironically toasted, maybe *literally*.”\n\nDeadpool rolled his neck, knuckles popping. “Looks like it’s improv night, fellas! Just don’t make me do mime, I got standards.”\n\nThe trio squared up as the room rippled—a stage set for chaos. Somewhere, an invisible audience leaned forward: the real show was about to begin.\n\nMorty’s knuckles whitened around a scorched joystick as Deadpool, perched atop the cracked pinball machine, surveyed the carnage with detached, royal amusement. Unstable threads of meta-energy crackled from the portal gun’s exposed core, arcing close enough to Rick’s hair to threaten a radioactive dye job.\n\nDeadpool eyed the blue lightning bolts. “Hey, science Santa, maybe let’s not roast us with existential lightning? I’m already medium-well on the inside.”\n\nRick spat out his screwdriver, voice acidic. “If you wanna fix this, go knock yourself out. Otherwise, shut up and let a grown-up try to save your break-the-universe schtick.”\n\nMorty peeked out, eyes wide. “It keeps glowing, Rick. That’s… that’s not like last time.” He glanced at Deadpool, some small hope for reassurance.\n\nDeadpool shrugged, offering none. “Normal died three floors ago, kiddo. But I give your defensive huddling a solid B-minus.”\n\nRick, sweat dripping into his wild hair, glared at the warped readings. “We’re on the edge of a meta-collapse—joke eats joke, reality drops the curtain, and we all vanish. Not comic book dead, not even reboot dead. Just nothing. You get me, Wade?”\n\nFor once, Deadpool stilled. The jests faded for a breath, the only sounds the portal’s humming and some rerun laugh track leaking from a cracked speaker. He glanced between them, the rare edge of fear in his voice. “So… all jokes aside, that’s *actual* dead dead?”\n\nRick didn’t flinch. “No healing factor, no retcons, no fourth-wall out. Gone.”\n\nMorty shifted closer, voice thin. “So what do we do?”\n\nRick nodded curtly, the flicker of desperation in his eyes. “You hold this line, Morty. Wade, you wanna be a hero—now’s your shot.”\n\nDeadpool vaulted from the pinball machine, tossing a silver ball at the rippling energy. The sphere sizzled before popping from existence. “Well, that bodes well. C’mon, team—if we’re going to die, let’s at least improvise our way into the highlight reel.”\n\nA new surge from the portal gun scattered arcade coins like shotgun pellets, skittering across the scarred floor. The three of them pressed in around the device—improvised heroes in a neon wasteland, bracing for oblivion but refusing to let it show.\n\nMeta-energy flickered in the stained carpet, circling their crumbling stronghold. Deadpool made a show of buffing his sword hilt. “Rick, how about next time you chase a self-referential anomaly, you aim your portal gun at something less precious than my crotch?”\n\nRick, elbow-deep in the sparking guts of an eviscerated Street Fighter machine, grunted. “Plot device, plot armor—quantum feedback doesn’t care. Gimme a sec––we’re working with chewed-up continuity and a pocket full of punchlines here.” He yanked free a sparking circuit board; its filaments spewed code in comic sans, snarking about the author himself.\n\nMorty held the ruined joystick like a lifeline. “Are reality’s stitches supposed to hum like that, or—also, my hands are turning tingly.” He glanced up at the trembling fourth wall, which shimmered to reveal flashes of hundreds—maybe thousands—of audience faces. Some bored. Some delighted. All impossibly, unreachably *real*.\n\nDeadpool hopped off the machine, finally—maybe—taking the threat with an iota of seriousness. “Gentlemen, if we’re going down, let’s at least keep the villain from draining the multiverse dry. Nobody wants to get erased by a bad punchline.” Above them, the rip in the fourth wall warped again, spitting out a canned laugh track before gulping it back.\n\nRick tossed Morty a circuit board. “Don’t let it burn your IQ. Deadpool, get ready. If we can hack the punchline stream, maybe we buy the multiverse a montage or two. Or a gracious exit cue.”\n\nDeadpool lifted his swords, striking a stagey pose. “You know, nothing makes me happier than existential improv. Except, maybe, a taco. Or—nah, let’s save the meta for the speech.”\n\nHe paused, gaze flicking—not just to the others, but to the fractured veil hovering above. “Let’s give them a show to remember. If anyone’s watching.”\n\nSomewhere beyond the fourth wall, the world leaned in and waited for their next move.\n\n---","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:46:15.275756-04:00"}
