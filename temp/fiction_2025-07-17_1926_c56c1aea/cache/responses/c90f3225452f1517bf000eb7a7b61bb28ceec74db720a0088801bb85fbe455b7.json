{"response":"Rick hauls himself up from a tangle of upside-down banisters, his lab coat smeared with spectral nacho cheese. “Morty, Deadpool—heads up! This M.C. Escher fever dream’s going recursive!” He flicks a glowing switch on his portal gun, sending static ripples through the impossible stairwells. Morty glances down as a stair beneath him melts into a slide, sending him hurtling past Deadpool.\n\n“Whoa—oh jeez, oh jeez—” Morty tumbles, slamming into Deadpool, who barely budges. Instead, Deadpool throws out an arm to steady him.\n\n“Relax, Morty. Worst case, we land in a Salvador Dalí clock factory and I finally get to prove I can punt a melting clock through a goalpost.

Rick yells, “Destabilization’s accelerating! If we don’t shut this down, we’ll end up as footnotes in a postmodern thesis!”\n\nDeadpool leaps forward, sword raised. “First time for everything! Let’s break outta the margins, boys.”\n\nAs the trio barrels ahead, the staircases begin to collapse into whiteness, erasing behind their every step.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:37:53.870156-04:00"}
