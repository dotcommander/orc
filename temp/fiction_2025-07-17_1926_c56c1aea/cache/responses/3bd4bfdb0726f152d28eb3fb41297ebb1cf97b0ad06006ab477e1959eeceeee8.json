{"response":"Morty watched Deadpool with a mix of awe and unease as the merc twirled the gun dangerously close to his own face. “Uh, Deadpool? Maybe don’t point that at your—” Morty’s voice faltered as Deadpool abruptly clicked the trigger. A dazzling flag marked BANG! popped out of the barrel. Deadpool grinned manically. “Relax, kid. Comedy gold. Also, I’m basically unkillable. Annoying, right? Yeah, I thought so too.”\n\nRick snorted, hunched over the dubious-looking device sprawled across the garage table. “I’ve seen better sight gags from space clowns. And trust me—they don’t get the punchlines either.” He yanked a glowing cable loose, which only made the blue readout on his portal gun blip more frantically.\n\nDeadpool flounced over, practically bouncing. “What’s this? Ooh, is that the multiversal flux inverter, or the blender? Because it’s about time for daiquiris. Wait, wait—press that one!”\n\nMorty interjected, edging away from the swirling vortex at the corner of the room. “Guys, shouldn’t we focus on, y’know, NOT getting erased from existence? Maybe less button-pressing, more—careful… science stuff?”\n\nA tiny portal hiccupped and spat out a rubber chicken, which flopped limply on the floor. Deadpool pounced, brandishing it like a sword. “A-ha! The Weaponized Humor Strikeforce assembles!”\n\nRick rolled his eyes so hard Morty worried they might actually escape their sockets. “The ‘villain’ is feeding off the entropy we create every time one of us cracks a joke. You want to win? Try shutting up for five minutes.”\n\nDeadpool froze mid-quip. Morty glanced nervously between them.\n\nA tremor rippled through the floor, rattling every beaker in the room. Something—some *presence*—seemed to loom just beyond the boundaries of reality.\n\nDeadpool’s grip tightened on the rubber chicken. “Guess we’re about to meet the meta-monster.”\n\nRick raised his portal gun, the targeting matrix glowing an ominous shade. “Showtime, kids.”","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:32:41.793728-04:00"}
