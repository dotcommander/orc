{"response":"**Chapter 3 Planning**\n\n---\n\n**1. Chapter Purpose**\n\n*Advance the plot by introducing The Meme Weaver and establishing the stakes. Deadpool, Rick, and Morty are forced to cooperate for the first time, traversing their first bizarre, meme-infested alternate universe and narrowly escaping a reality glitch—bonding slightly through shared peril and confusion.*\n\n---\n\n**2. Chapter Title**\n\n*“Meme-ing of Life: Enter The Weaver”*\n\n---\n\n**3. Three Scenes**\n\n---\n\n### **Scene 1: “Bug in the System” (~333 words)**\n\n**Objective:**  \nEstablish team dynamics and immediate stakes as the universe glitches—all reality begins morphing unpredictably after Deadpool’s crash-landing. Tensions flare as Rick tries frantically to stabilize his experiment, Morty panics, and Deadpool gleefully makes things worse.\n\n*Deadpool picks himself up amid the chaos, firing off meta jokes; Rick curses at him while chimichangas and broken gadgets float through sudden anti-gravity. Morty begs Rick to fix things just as the lights flicker and the garage shifts into a pixelated meme landscape. The team’s first, unwilling alliance forms out of necessity as Rick yells out technical instructions and Deadpool improvises to stop Morty from being devoured by a glitchy, doge-faced Roomba. Their disorderly “teamwork” barely buys them stability—but too late: The Meme Weaver’s sigil flickers in the sky, and a threatening, omnipresent voice booms, announcing their doom and mocking their respective foibles.*\n\n---\n\n### **Scene 2: “The Meme Dimension” (~333 words)**\n\n**Objective:**  \nDeadpool, Rick, and Morty are involuntarily sucked into a meme-drenched alternate universe, where reality is governed by nonsensical logic and parody versions of themselves lurk. The trio must navigate this warped world, forced to work together to evade a barrage of viral “traps.”\n\n*They awaken in a universe made of looping meme formats. Rick’s catchphrases spin through the air as literal weapons, Deadpool’s speech bubbles become grenades, and Morty is attacked by an army of “Distracted Boyfriend” clones. They realize their own egos and meta-gimmicks are literally being used against them, and each must reluctantly help the other: Rick hacks a sentient “Loss” comic to open a portal, Deadpool neutralizes viral hashtags with a katana, Morty translates meme logic to keep them moving. Tensions escalate as The Meme Weaver’s influence grows, reality distorts, and their bickering nearly gets them trapped permanently—until Morty (unexpectedly) cracks the meme code and launches them into the next layer of broken reality.*\n\n---\n\n### **Scene 3: “Threaded Together” (~334 words)**\n\n**Objective:**  \nReeling from their near-permanent meme demise, the trio lands—briefly—on common emotional ground. They glimpse how The Meme Weaver feeds on their personas and realize that only working together (however unnatural it feels) will help them survive.\n\n*After tumbling through a slapstick portal, the three crash into a space that resembles a cosmic social media feed, their profiles flashing with every insecurity and “inside joke” they hide behind. The Meme Weaver taunts them with deep-cut references, momentarily sapping each of their powers. Deadpool’s healing factor flickers, Rick’s portal gun misfires, Morty stammers more than usual. All three finally admit (with much snark and defensiveness) that they might be in over their heads. They truce out of dire necessity, combining Rick’s science, Deadpool’s unpredictability, and Morty’s surprisingly insightful meme analysis for one desperate move as they face the next glitch. The scene ends with the first hint of uneasy alliance—and The Meme Weaver’s promise that “things are about to get really meta.”*\n\n---\n\n**(Total: ~1000 words outlined, divided into 3 focused scenes with escalating stakes and clear objectives.)**","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:27:12.57422-04:00"}
