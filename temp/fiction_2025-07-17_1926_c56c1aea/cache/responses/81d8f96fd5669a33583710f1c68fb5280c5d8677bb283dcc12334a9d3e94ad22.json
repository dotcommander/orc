{"response":"Morty shuffled his feet uneasily, casting nervous glances at the splintered rafters above. “S-So, uh, what now? We just stand around until the existential dread kicks in, or…?”\n\nDeadpool bent over, brushing wood dust from his shoulder. “Kid, the existential dread is like cable—always running in the background. But hey, at least we have each other! Nothing like a little found family, right?” He waggled his eyebrows behind his mask.\n\nRick, ignoring them both, rummaged through the cracked crates with a grumble. “If either of you talks about feelings, I’m opening a portal straight into a supermassive black hole. And you’re both going first.”\n\nHe tossed aside a crate lid, revealing an unsettling device covered in blinking lights and scribbled warnings. Deadpool sidled up, poking at the buttons. “Ooh. Is this the part where the mysterious object ominously advances the plot?” He grinned, voice bouncing with glee. “I hope it explodes.”\n\n“Don’t touch that!” Rick barked, snatching the device away. “This thing could destabilize reality—more than you two idiots already have. I just need—”\n\nMorty cut in, voice trembling but determined. “Rick, look, if this, uh, whatever-it-is, can get us back home, can you just do it? I don’t wanna get erased by meta-jokes or whatever.”\n\nRick fixed Morty with a rare, almost gentle gaze, then turned to Deadpool. “You. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve ever survived?”\n\nDeadpool leaned against a half-collapsed pillar, appraising Rick. “Define ‘survived.’ Physically? Emotionally? Mentally? Spoiler alert: failed the last two. But hey, keep it moving, Drunky McScience.”\n\nRick cracked the faintest smile, tools whirring. “Then buckle up, boys. We’re going hunting for the punchline behind all this. Try not to die—unless you’re into that sort of thing.”\n\nMorty sucked in a breath as reality flickered. The room’s shadows crawled, hinting that they weren’t alone after all.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:31:35.881881-04:00"}
