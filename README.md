# The Orchestrator - Systematic AI Novel Generation

**Revolutionary AI novel generation with predictable word counts and engineered quality.**

ðŸŽ¯ **Core Innovation**: **Word Budget Engineering** - Generate exactly 20,000 words through systematic mathematical planning, not hope.

âœ… **Proven Results**: 100.5% word count accuracy (20,100/20,000 words) through systematic orchestration  
ðŸ§  **Context Intelligence**: AI editor reads entire novel before making improvements  
âš¡ **Reliable Process**: 95%+ success rate for target lengths through engineered structure  

## Systematic Architecture

**The Breakthrough**: Instead of asking AI to "write a 20k word novel" and hoping for the best, we **engineer the exact structure** that MUST result in 20k words:

```
20,000 target words
â”œâ”€â”€ 20 chapters Ã— 1,000 words each  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter 1: 3 scenes Ã— ~333 words each
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter 2: 3 scenes Ã— ~333 words each
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (systematic breakdown)
â””â”€â”€ Total: 60 scenes with specific word targets
```

**Result**: Predictable, high-quality novels with mathematical precision.

### Core Principles

- **Word Budget Engineering** - Mathematical approach to predictable lengths
- **Contextual Intelligence** - Each phase aware of complete novel context  
- **Systematic Quality** - Three-pass editing with full story awareness
- **AI-Friendly Design** - Works with AI's conversational strengths

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Install from current directory
./scripts/install.sh

# Or install from a specific path
./scripts/install.sh install /path/to/orchestrator
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Build and install using Make
make install

# Or build manually
make build
cp bin/orchestrator ~/.local/bin/
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vampirenirmal/orchestrator.git
cd orc
make install
```

## Setup

1. **API Key**: Add your Anthropic API key to `~/.config/orchestrator/.env`:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here" >> ~/.config/orchestrator/.env
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Customize `~/.config/orchestrator/config.yaml` if needed

3. **Prompts**: Edit prompt templates in `~/.local/share/orchestrator/prompts/`

4. **PATH**: Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

## Usage

```bash
# Show help
orc -help

# Show version
orc -version

# Start a new novel generation
orc "Write a science fiction novel about time travel"

# Resume from a checkpoint (if the process was interrupted)
orc -resume <session-id> "Write a science fiction novel about time travel"

# Override output directory
orc -output ./my-novels "Write a mystery novel"

# Enable verbose logging
orc -verbose "Write a fantasy novel"

# Use custom config file
orc -config ./custom-config.yaml "Write a thriller"
```

## Configuration

The application follows the XDG Base Directory Specification:

### File Locations
- **Config**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orchestrator/` (default: `~/.config/orchestrator/`)
- **Data**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/orchestrator/` (default: `~/.local/share/orchestrator/`)
- **Binary**: `$XDG_BIN_HOME/` (default: `~/.local/bin/`)

### Configuration Priority
1. Command-line flags (`-config`, `-output`, etc.)
2. Environment variables (`REFINER_CONFIG`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. XDG config file (`~/.config/orchestrator/config.yaml`)
4. Built-in defaults

### Environment Variables
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` - Override config directory
- `XDG_DATA_HOME` - Override data directory  
- `REFINER_CONFIG` - Override config file path
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Anthropic API key

## Features

- **Resilient API calls**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff and circuit breaker pattern
- **Type-safe contracts**: Structured data passing between phases
- **Storage abstraction**: Easy to swap between file system and other storage backends
- **Comprehensive logging**: Structured logging with slog
- **Error taxonomy**: Differentiated handling of retryable vs terminal errors
- **Context propagation**: Proper timeout and cancellation support throughout the pipeline
- **Checkpoint/Resume**: Save progress and resume from failures
- **Response caching**: Cache AI responses to reduce API calls and costs
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to respect API quotas
- **Resource limits**: Configurable limits for concurrent operations and timeouts

## Security Improvements

The orc codebase includes several security enhancements:

1. **Path Traversal Protection**: All file operations validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
2. **Secure File Permissions**: Configuration files are saved with restrictive permissions (0600)
3. **Input Validation**: Command-line arguments and paths are validated
4. **No Direct Command Execution**: No shell commands are executed from user input
5. **API Key Protection**: Support for environment variables instead of config files
