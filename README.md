## 🌋 What is The Orchestrator?

The Orchestrator (affectionately called "Orc") is a powerful AI content generation system that commands multiple AI agents to create high-quality content through structured, iterative processes. Built with the robustness of Go and the intelligence of GPT-4, it transforms simple prompts into complete novels, production-ready code, and comprehensive documentation.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🎭 Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Commands specialized AI personas working in harmony
- **📚 Novel Generation** - Creates full-length fiction with consistent plot and characters
- **💻 Code Generation** - Builds complete applications with best practices
- **🔌 Plugin Architecture** - Extend with custom content generators
- **🛡️ Enterprise-Grade** - Circuit breakers, health monitoring, and security controls
- **🌊 Fluid Execution** - Adaptive orchestration that flows like water

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install The Orchestrator
go install github.com/dotcommander/orc/cmd/orc@latest

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Generate a novel
orc create fiction "Write a sci-fi thriller about AI consciousness"

# Generate code
orc create code "Build a REST API for task management in Go"

# List available plugins
orc plugins
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Orchestrator employs a sophisticated multi-phase architecture:

```
User Request → Conversational Exploration → Planning → Execution → Refinement → Assembly
```

Each phase is handled by specialized AI agents:
- **🧙 Strategic Architects** - Plan the overall structure
- **⚒️ Targeted Builders** - Create focused content
- **🔍 Quality Inspectors** - Ensure excellence
- **📜 Master Assemblers** - Weave everything together

## 🔌 Plugin System

Create your own content generators with our powerful plugin framework:

```bash
# Create a new plugin scaffold
orc-plugin create poetry fiction

# Your plugin is ready for customization!
cd orchestrator-poetry-plugin
make build
```

### Plugin Features
- **📦 Manifest-Based** - Declarative plugin configuration
- **🔒 Capability Security** - Fine-grained permission control
- **💪 Resilience Patterns** - Circuit breakers and retry logic
- **📡 Event Bus** - Inter-plugin communication
- **❤️ Health Monitoring** - Continuous status checks

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Generate a Novel
```bash
orc create fiction "A fantasy epic about a reluctant hero"
```

### Build an Application
```bash
orc create code "Create a React dashboard with authentication"
```

### Resume Previous Work
```bash
orc resume abc123def
```

### Configure Settings
```bash
orc config set ai.model gpt-4
orc config set ai.temperature 0.8
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The Orchestrator follows XDG Base Directory standards:

- **Config**: `~/.config/orchestrator/config.yaml`
- **Data**: `~/.local/share/orchestrator/`
- **Plugins**: `~/.local/share/orchestrator/plugins/`

### Example Configuration
```yaml
ai:
  model: gpt-4
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 8000

limits:
  max_concurrent_requests: 3
  rate_limit_rpm: 30

plugins:
  fiction:
    max_chapter_length: 5000
  code:
    language_preference: go
```

## 🏛️ Advanced Features

### Iterator Agent Architecture
The Orchestrator employs revolutionary iterator agents that refine content until all quality criteria pass:

```
Initial Draft → Quality Check → Iterative Improvement → Final Output
                     ↑                    ↓
                     ←────── Retry ←──────
```

### "Be Like Water" Philosophy
Adaptive orchestration that flows naturally with AI capabilities, adjusting strategies based on:
- Content complexity
- Quality requirements
- Available resources
- Real-time feedback
