<world_rules>
Dream Logic Laws:
1. Time flows differently (1 hour real = 8 hours dream)
2. Emotional resonance affects landscape stability
3. Shared symbols have objective power
4. Death in dreams causes permanent coma
5. Can only enter dreams during REM sleep
6. Dreamer's subconscious can reject intruders
7. Objects from dreams can't cross to reality (or can they?)

Reality Anchors:
- Maya's insomnia makes her vulnerable
- Physical wounds appear after dream injuries
- Dream walking causes nosebleeds (visual cue)
- Each journey erodes boundary between states
