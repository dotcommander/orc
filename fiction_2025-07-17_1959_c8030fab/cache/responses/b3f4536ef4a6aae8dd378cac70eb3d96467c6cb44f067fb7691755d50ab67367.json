{"response":"**Hook:**  \nDetective Mara Ellison stands alone at the unsolved crime board, staring at the haunting photograph of a missing girl from 1991—her first case in the Cold Case Unit, and one nobody else in the precinct cares to touch.\n\n**Inciting Event:**  \nOn her first day, Mara uncovers overlooked evidence in the case files, finding a link between several decades-old disappearances and an influential local family, thrusting her into a labyrinth of buried secrets and denial.\n\n**Rising Action:**  \nAs Mara digs deeper into forgotten police reports and lost witnesses, she faces pressure from powerful community members and resistance from colleagues, while old wounds—personal and societal—surface, drawing her dangerously close to both the truth and her own unresolved traumas.\n\n**Climax:**  \nMara corners the long-unseen perpetrator in an abandoned property, forcing a tense confrontation where she must choose between crossing ethical lines for justice or upholding the law, all under the shadow of public scrutiny and her haunted past.\n\n**Falling Action:**  \nThe resolution of the case sends shockwaves through the department and the community, exposing culpability and healing some wounds but also leaving Mara to wrestle with the cost: her reputation, strained relationships, and the realization that some truths bring as much pain as closure.\n\n**Resolution:**  \nMara quietly returns to her desk, determined yet forever changed, resolved to continue bringing light to the forgotten—even if redemption and ruin are forever intertwined in her pursuit of justice.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:59:59.424156-04:00"}
