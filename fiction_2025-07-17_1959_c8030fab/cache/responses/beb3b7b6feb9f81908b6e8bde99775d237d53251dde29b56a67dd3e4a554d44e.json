{"response":"Certainly! Here’s a detailed Chapter Plan for Chapter 2 of your novel, tying directly into your provided context and story arc.\n\n---\n\n**1. Chapter Purpose**\n\n*To establish Mara’s entry into the Cold Case Unit and immerse her in the chilling atmosphere of the unsolved caseboard; to introduce the 1991 missing girl case as her first challenge; to spark Mara’s obsession by having her discover overlooked evidence hinting at wider corruption; and to begin the thread of institutional reluctance that will create obstacles throughout the story.*\n\n---\n\n**2. Chapter Title**\n\n**\"Ghosts on the Board\"**\n\n---\n\n**3. Three Scenes with Objectives and Word Targets**\n\n---\n\n**Scene 1: \"First Impressions\" (~333 words)**  \n**Objective:** Introduce Mara’s arrival at the precinct's Cold Case Unit; establish the oppressive silence and skepticism from her colleagues; have Mara drawn to the unsolved crime board, fixating particularly on the faded photo of the missing girl from 1991. Foreshadow the emotional and professional isolation Mara will face.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 2: \"Paper Trails and Shadows\" (~333 words)**  \n**Objective:** Mara begins reviewing the dusty case files at her tiny new desk. She uncovers a piece of neglected evidence—a police interview transcript or photo connecting the 1991 girl’s disappearance to other missing children. The moment of discovery captivates and rattles her. This scene should deftly begin establishing a link to a prominent family and hint at possible internal cover-up or oversight.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 3: \"Warnings, Whispers, Denials\" (~334 words)**  \n**Objective:** Mara attempts to raise questions about her findings but meets subtle resistance from a supervisor or veteran detective. She receives indirect warnings not to dig too deep—maybe in the form of veiled skepticism, a dismissive attitude, or a pointed change of subject. This scene closes with Mara resolving, despite the atmosphere, to pursue the newly revealed connection, laying the groundwork for conflict and suspense.\n\n---\n\n**Total Chapter Target: ~1,000 words**  \nEach scene is focused, introduces or advances key elements (setting, main case, antagonists/institutional resistance), and lays down hooks for the reader and Mara’s arc.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T20:00:18.130861-04:00"}
