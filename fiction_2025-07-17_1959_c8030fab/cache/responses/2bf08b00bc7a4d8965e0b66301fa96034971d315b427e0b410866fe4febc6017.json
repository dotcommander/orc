{"response":"**Primary Location:**\n- **Cold Case Unit Office:** Once a bustling precinct hub, this windowless basement office now feels more like a reliquary, stacked with battered file boxes and cork boards pinned with sun-faded photos. Flickering fluorescent lights cast tired shadows, mirroring the unit's forgotten cases and Mara’s own sense of exile.\n\n**Secondary Locations:**\n- **Archive Rooms:** Dim municipal basements filled with dust and old evidence bags, where Mara sifts through records and relics, each artifact a fragment of a lost life.\n- **Victims’ Neighborhoods:** Aging suburbs and decaying urban blocks, haunted by neglect and rumor. Time has changed these places, but scars and silences remain.\n- **Detective’s Home:** Mara’s small, sparsely furnished apartment—a sanctuary but also a space of solitude, where findings and doubts echo after hours.\n- **Police Headquarters:** Stark, bustling with newer cases and ambitious officers, highlighting the contrast between the urgent present and the cold, lingering past.\n\n**Why These Settings Matter:**\nThese environments embody the story’s core tension: cold cases live in the shadows—neglected by institutions, fading from public memory, but stubbornly alive for those left behind. Mara’s journey through forgotten archives and wounded neighborhoods mirrors her internal confrontation with loss, persistence, and the unresolved pain that justice can’t always heal. Each setting grounds the story’s emotional stakes, turning physical spaces into echoes of mystery and memory.","timestamp":"2025-07-17T19:59:53.940655-04:00"}
