{"response":"Certainly! Here's your detailed chapter outline for Chapter 3:\n\n---\n\n**1. Chapter Purpose (What Advances the Plot):**\n\nChapter 3 serves to escalate the stakes and deepen the personal and professional conflicts facing Detective Mara Ellison. In this chapter, Mara pushes further into the cold case, discovering a crucial connection between the missing girl and a prominent local family. The chapter intensifies external pressures—resistance from colleagues and hints of interference from powerful community members—and pushes Mara to confront internal struggles tied to her own past. The groundwork is laid for all the major conflicts and emotional beats that will carry through the rest of the book.\n\n---\n\n**2. Chapter Title:**\n\n**“Threads in the Dark”**\n\n---\n\n**3. Three Scenes with Specific Objectives and Word Targets:**\n\n---\n\n**Scene 1: “Echoes in the Evidence” (~333 words)**  \n**Objective:** Mara, working late and alone in the archive room, dives into old police reports and evidence boxes. She discovers overlooked items—a child’s hair ribbon and a torn photograph—that hint at a connection between the missing girl and another disappearance from the same era. This gives Mara her first tangible clue linking cases but also highlights procedural failures and neglect from the original investigators. The scene ends with Mara determined to pursue this fresh lead, despite knowing it will stir up trouble.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 2: “Walls Closing In” (~333 words)**  \n**Objective:** Mara attempts to interview a retired officer who worked the original case but finds him evasive and fearful, warning her about getting involved with “certain families.” Meanwhile, word spreads through the department that Mara is poking around where she shouldn’t. Colleagues subtly distance themselves, and her supervisor cautions her to tread carefully. This scene raises the external stakes and shows the institutional resistance Mara faces, deepening the sense of isolation around her.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 3: “Personal Fault Lines” (~334 words)**  \n**Objective:** Alone in her dingy apartment, Mara pores over her findings. The weight of the case triggers memories of her own unresolved trauma—a lost sibling, hinted at through fragmented flashbacks. She calls a surviving relative of the missing girl, arranging a secretive meeting for the next day. The scene closes with Mara, vulnerable but resolute, understanding that digging up the past will come at a cost but unwilling to let the forgotten remain lost.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a detailed scene breakdown or want to see the drafted text for any of these scenes!","timestamp":"2025-07-17T20:00:25.087558-04:00"}
