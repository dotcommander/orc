{"response":"Absolutely, here's a detailed chapter breakdown as requested:\n\n---\n\n**1. Chapter Purpose:**  \nThis chapter marks a turning point for Mara Ellison. She finally secures a face-to-face interview with a critical, long-ignored witness in the 1991 missing girl case, shedding new light on the night of the disappearance. As she draws out the witness’s story—amidst resistance and fear—Mara uncovers a vital, hidden piece of evidence that directly implicates the influential local family. At the same time, Mara faces retaliation from within her department, escalating the stakes of her investigation and isolating her further. This sets the stage for the high-stakes confrontation to come.\n\n---\n\n**2. Chapter Title:**  \n**Whispers Through Cracked Glass**\n\n---\n\n**3. Three Scenes with Objectives and Word Targets**\n\n### Scene 1: **The Reluctant Witness** *(~333 words)*\n**Objective:** Mara meets with Ruthie Sellers, a former neighbor and the last known person to see the missing girl alive. The scene probes Ruthie’s fractured memories and overwhelming fear of local reprisals, while Mara must earn her trust and coax out the truth. The encounter brings to the surface a cryptic detail about a car seen idling on the street that fateful night—hinting at a family member's involvement.\n\n---\n\n### Scene 2: **A Photograph Reconsidered** *(~333 words)*\n**Objective:** Back at the precinct, Mara reviews the old evidence files with new context from Ruthie's testimony. She discovers a previously unnoticed background detail in a faded photograph—what looks like the same distinctive car described by Ruthie. This connection galvanizes Mara’s theory, but as she prepares to dig deeper, she finds her computer has been tampered with and some files are missing. Internal sabotage is implied, escalating her sense of danger and urgency.\n\n---\n\n### Scene 3: **Lines Drawn** *(~334 words)*\n**Objective:** Mara confronts her superior about the tampered evidence, only to receive a thinly veiled warning to drop the case for her own good. The scene sharpens the stakes and reinforces Mara’s growing isolation within the department, but also her determination: she vows to protect both the witness and the truth, even as retaliation looms. By the end, she quietly arranges a secret meet-up with a trusted ally—hinting at preparations for the inevitable confrontation ahead.\n\n---","timestamp":"2025-07-17T20:02:33.744696-04:00"}
